Add the onions and a few dashes of salt. Cook, stirring occasionally, until the onions have softened and are turning translucent, about 3 to 6 minutes.\nAdd the garlic and cumin. Cook, stirring constantly, until fragrant, about 30 seconds. Pour in the drained beans and water. Stir, cover and cook for 5 minutes. Reduce the heat to low, then remove the lid and use a potato masher or the back of a fork to mash up about at least half of the beans. Continue to cook the beans, uncovered, stirring often, for 3 more minutes.\nRemove the pot from the heat and stir in the salt and pepper. Taste, and add more salt and/or pepper if necessary. If the beans seem dry, add a very small splash of water and stir to combine. Spread the beans into an even layer in a shallow, medium-sized serving bowl.\nTo prepare the guacamole: Use a spoon to scoop the flesh of the avocado into a small mixing bowl. Add the lime juice and salt. Mash with a clean potato masher or fork until the mixture is blended and no longer chunky. Taste and add additional lime juice and/or salt, if necessary. Spread the guacamole on top of the beans, leaving the outer \u00bd\u201d of beans visible for presentation value.\nTo avoid watering down your dip, drain the salsa in a fine mesh colander, or use a fork to transfers the solids onto the guacamole, again leaving the outer \u00bd\u201d of the guacamole visible.\nTo prepare the pico de gallo: In a medium bowl, combine the tomatoes, onion, cilantro, lime juice and salt. Stir to combine, then use a fork to pile the pico on top of the salsa, leaving behind as much of the juices as possible. Top with a sprinkle of chopped pickled jalape\u00f1o, if using.", "nutrients": {}, "links": ["https://cookieandkate.com#comment-382636", "https://cookieandkate.com#comment-379850",
