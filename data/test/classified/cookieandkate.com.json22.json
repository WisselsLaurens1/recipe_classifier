Alternatively, you can warm them directly over a low flame on a gas range. Or, just microwave them in a stack for about 15 to 20 seconds. Stack the warmed tortillas and wrap them with a tea towel to keep warm.\nCrack the eggs into a bowl and whisk with a fork until the mixture is combined and pure yellow. Add the sour cream or milk, a couple dashes of hot sauce, and \u00bc teaspoon of the salt. Whisk to combine, then place the bowl near the stove for later.\nIn a large skillet, melt 1 tablespoon of the butter over medium heat. Add the vegetables, the remaining \u00bc teaspoon salt, and the chili powder and cumin. Stir to combine, and cook, stirring occasionally, until the vegetables are tender throughout (about 5 minutes), dialing down the heat to medium-low after a few minutes have passed. Once cooked, transfer the vegetables to a bowl and set aside.\nReturn the skillet to the stove over medium-low heat, and melt the remaining \u00bd tablespoon butter. Pour in the egg mixture. Use a spatula to gently stir and push the eggs around the skillet until the eggs are clumpy but still slightly wet, about 3 to 5 minutes.\nRemove the skillet from the heat. Add the cheese (if using) and green onion, and gently stir to combine.\nAssemble your tacos by spooning scrambled eggs down the length of a tortilla, topping with some cooked veggies, and your garnishes of choice. Enjoy warm. Leftover tacos will keep fairly well in the refrigerator for up to 4 days; gently reheat before serving.", "nutrients": {"servingSize": "1 hearty taco made with flour tortilla and cheddar cheese, no
