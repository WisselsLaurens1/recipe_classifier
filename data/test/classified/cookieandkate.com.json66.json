Cut the potatoes into even chunks about 2\u201d in size (see photos).\nPlace the potato chunks in a large Dutch oven or soup pot. Add 1 teaspoon of the salt, and enough water to cover the potatoes by 1 to 2 inches.\nBring the mixture to a boil over high heat. Continue cooking, reducing the heat as necessary to prevent overflow, until the potatoes are easily pierced through by a fork, about 10 to 15 minutes.\nCarefully drain off all of the water and leave the potatoes in the colander for now.\nReturn the empty pot to the stove over medium-high heat and add 1 tablespoon of the butter. Once melted, add the chopped kale. Cook, stirring often, for 2 to 4 minutes, until the kale has wilted and turned dark green. Add the garlic and cook until fragrant, about 30 seconds to 1 minute.\nRemove the pot from the heat and add the drained potatoes. Mash the potatoes and kale until the potatoes reach your desired consistency (I like mine a little chunky, but you can mash them completely smooth if you prefer).\nAdd the cream cheese, sour cream, remaining 1 tablespoon of butter, and 1 teaspoon salt. Mash it together until the mixture is mostly combined, then add 2 tablespoons of the green onions and stir until everything comes together.\nTransfer the mashed potatoes to a serving bowl. Top with a couple pats of butter and the remaining tablespoon of green onions. Serve while warm.", "nutrients": {}, "links": ["https://cookieandkate.com#comment-527656", "https://cookieandkate.com/tag/avocado/", "https://cookieandkate.com/category/vegetarian-mexican-recipes/",
