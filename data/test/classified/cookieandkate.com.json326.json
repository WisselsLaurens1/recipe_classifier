Blend while drizzling in the water and olive oil. Continue to blend until the dressing is smooth and creamy.\nWarm the beans: in a large skillet, heat a drizzle of olive oil over medium heat. Saut\u00e9 the onion and garlic for a couple of minutes, then add the cumin and saut\u00e9 for another minute. Pour in one can of black beans with all of its cooking liquid, then drain the other can, reserving the juices for later if necessary. Pour the remaining beans into the pan and stir in the chili powder and cayenne pepper.\nTurn up the heat to medium-high and simmer the beans for 7 to 10 minutes. Use a fork or the back of a wooden spoon to mash up about \u00bd of the beans. Reduce heat as necessary and add more of the cooking liquid if the mixture seems too dry. Remove the beans from heat and stir in the sherry vinegar and salt, to taste.\nTo serve, place a generous amount of beans on a salad plate, then top the beans with a romaine halve. Spread several spoonfuls of avocado sauce over the romaine and top it with lots of pico de gallo. Garnish with toasted pepitas or crumbled feta cheese, if you\u2019d like.", "nutrients": {}, "links": ["https://cookieandkate.com/tag/avocado/",
