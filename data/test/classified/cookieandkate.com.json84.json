Stir to combine.\nAdd a large ice cube or several small, and gently stir in a circular motion until the drink is very cold, about 20 seconds. Taste, and stir in \u00bc to \u00bd teaspoon more maple syrup if you prefer a sweeter drink.\nUse a vegetable peeler to remove a hefty strip of orange peel. Gently twist it, skin side down, over the drink to release the oils. Then place the orange peel in the glass.
