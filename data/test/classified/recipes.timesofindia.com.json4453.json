Make sure that you discard the basal plate of onions that joins the layers in order to avoid the bitter taste. While cutting the tomatoes, take out the pulp and then cut them. Next, put a small pan on medium flame and fry the chana dal in 1 teaspoon of oil. Once done, let it cool down and then grind to a fine powder.\nNext, take a large bowl and add yoghurt into it, and then add fried gram powder (chana dal) 30 grams approx or 2 tablespoons in the bowl. Now, add one tablespoon of ginger-garlic paste, turmeric, red chill powder, coriander powder, salt as per your taste, along with kasoori methi powder, chaat masala powder, and refined oil. (Leave a little masala for the final dish.) Mix all the ingredients to prepare the marinade. Then, mix in the cubed capsicum, onion, and tomatoes into it. Now, carefully add paneer cubes in the mixture and let the veggies marinate for about 30 minutes in the refrigerator.\nAfter 30 minutes of marination: Put a frying pan on medium flame and add 2 to 3 tablespoons of refined oil into it. When the oil is hot enough, slowly add all the marinated veggies and saute over these marinated stuffs until they turn light brown in colour. Turn them upside down after paneer pieces turn brownish. When both sides of the paneer turn brownish, take them out of the pan. The paneer tikka is ready.\nNow, you need to prepare the gravy. For the same, put a deep frying pan on medium flame and heat 4 to 5 tablespoons of refined oil into it. When the oil is hot enough, add the cumin seeds along with asafoetida in it, let them splutter and then add the fried paneer pieces in the pan. Fry till the paneer pieces are little brown in colour. Then, add the tomato puree into the pan along with the rest of garam masala powder, kasoori methi powder, cumin seeds powder, coriander powder, red chilli powder, chaat masala powder and salt as per your taste. Mix all of them and cook for about 10 minutes.\nNow, add rest of the fried gram powder into the pan and add water to it. Stir and mix all the ingredients, and bring it to a boil. Afterwards, add milk into the pan and turn the flame to high. Mix everything and cover the pan and cook for about 5 minutes. After 5 minutes, uncover the pan and keep the flame medium now. (The reason for keeping the flame low and high is the content of milk added to the gravy). Stir in between occasionally and after 5 minutes, add the prepared paneer tikka in the gravy. Stir well and bring it to a boil over medium flame for about 2 to 3 minutes. Paneer Tikka Masala is ready now, garnish with chopped coriander leaves.
