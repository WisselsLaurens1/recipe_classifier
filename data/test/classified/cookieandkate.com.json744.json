Add the onion and saut\u00e9 for 3 minutes, then add the garlic, red pepper flakes, 1 tablespoon of the fresh basil (or \u00bc teaspoon dried), and oregano, and saut\u00e9 for 1 minute.\nAdd the white wine vinegar and saut\u00e9 for 1 minute, then carefully add the tomatoes, salt, and several grinds of black pepper. Reduce the heat, cover, and allow the mixture to simmer, lightly bubbling, for 10 minutes. Taste and adjust seasonings as desired (if you want a spicier dip, add more red pepper flakes!).\nSpoon the tomato sauce into shallow baking dishes or ramekins, then add dollops of goat cheese. Bake until the cheese is warmed through, about 15 minutes. If desired, broil for a minute or two to brown the top of the cheese.\nLet the dip cool for a few minutes, then top with the remaining 1 teaspoon fresh basil (optional) and a light drizzle of olive oil. Serve warm, with crusty bread on the side.", "nutrients": {"servingSize": "1 appetizer serving, no bread or extra olive oil", "calories": "150", "sugarContent": "5.5 g", "sodiumContent": "461.6 mg",
