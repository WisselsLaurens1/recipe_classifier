Remember to use fresh and moist khoya. Soak washed moong dal at room temperature water for 3-4 hrs and make a coarse paste by grinding it. Heat 2-3 tbsp of ghee in a wok and add the lentil puree in it.\nCook for 7-10 mins or until you can smell the aroma of roasted lentil. Once the dal is cooked, add mawa/ khoya, sugar and coconut powder gradually, one at a time, and keep stirring as you incorporate everything.\nAdd chopped nuts and raisins and stir. Also, sprinkle the cardamom powder (or essence) and nutmeg powder. This is time to switch off the flame and then add1 tsp of ghee before you give it a final stir. Transfer the mixture to a large flat plate to bring it to room temperature.\nPreparing the Dough for Pastry: Sieve and sift the flour, salt, baking soda and baking powder together, twice. Add 1.5 tbsp to 2 tbsp of melted ghee (clarified butter) or regular butter to the flour and mix well.\nKnead dough using cold water until it becomes a super soft and smooth pliable dough.\nCover the dough with cling film and allow it to rest for 30 mins or overnight in the refrigerator. After the resting period, the dough will be pliable comfortably. Now you can use the dough whenever you are ready to bake.\nForming the Gujiya for baking: Take out one small dough ball at a time and roll it out to 3mm thick sheet or disc using a rolling pin. Place it on the gujiya/ karanji maker/ mould and fill with 2-3 tsp of stuffing. Brush the edges with water to seal it properly; close the mould and gently unmold the gujiya.\nAvoid pressing hard; gujiya is still very soft and fragile. Follow the same with the rest of the dough. Use different moulds to create new surprises.\nRemove the excess dough from the mould (from sides) and store them with rest of the dough balls to reuse them. Place the gujiya in a covered bowl/ pan. While working with one portion of the dough; keep the rest of the dough covered so that it doesnt dry up.\nBaking the Gujiya: Place all the gujiyas in a greased (use reserved ghee) baking pan and arrange in a single layer. Brush them with ghee/butter/oil and put in a preheated (1800C) oven.\nBake the gujiya at 1800C for 20-25 mins (depending on the oven). If you are using the top shelf then you don\u2019t need to turn them while getting baked, else you will have to take them out and turn them after 10-12 mins once, to achieve the even golden brown colour.\nOnce done, remove the pan from oven and keep it on wire rack to bring to room temperature.\nIf you want to glaze your gujiya, mix saffron and warm condensed milk together and brush them on Baked Mawa Gujiya. Bake them for another 5 mins at 1800C and follow the rest. Sprinkle the whole or crushed nuts (whichever you prefer) on top and serve.", "nutrients": {"servingSize": "1 bowl", "calories": "772 cal"}, "links":
