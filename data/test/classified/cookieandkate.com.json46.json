Working in batches, pulse the chunks in a food processor with the S-blade until they\u2019re broken into tiny pieces, just bigger than couscous. (See recipe notes if you don\u2019t have a food processor.)\nWrap the cauliflower rice in a clean tea towel or paper towels, twist, and squeeze as much water as possible from the rice\u2014you might be surprised by how much water you can wring out, or you might not be. Cauliflower varies quite a bit in its moisture level, and this step ensures that it cooks well.\nWarm the skillet over medium heat. Add the olive oil, followed by the garlic. Cook while stirring just until the garlic is fragrant, about 10 to 20 seconds. Add the cauliflower rice and salt, and stir to combine. Cook, stirring just every minute or so, until the cauliflower rice is hot and turning golden in places, about 6 to 10 minutes.\nRemove the skillet from the heat. Stir in the chopped fresh herbs and citrus, if using. Season to taste with salt and pepper, and serve warm. Leftover cauliflower rice will keep well in the fridge for up to 4 days. Gently reheat in the microwave or on the stovetop before serving.", "nutrients": {"servingSize": "1 side serving", "calories": "91", "sugarContent": "2.2 g", "sodiumContent": "180.6 mg", "fatContent":
