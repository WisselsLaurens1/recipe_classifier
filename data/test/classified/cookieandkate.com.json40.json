For best flavor, let the cheese warm to room temperature for about 30 minutes before serving.\nUse a fork to create large chunks of blue cheese and Parmesan. Slice semi-hard cheese, like cheddar, and fan them across a section of the board. Cut wedges of brie into slices and soft round cheeses into wedges (it\u2019s totally fine to leave portions of cheese whole).\nPlace small bowls of tapenade, olives, honey, or jam on the board. Add color by filling large blank areas with sliced fruit, then place your crackers and nuts across the board in clusters.\nPlace small spoons or serving utensils in bowls, and position cheese knives near the relevant cheeses. Look at your board and fill any bare spots with additional nuts or fruit. You might drizzle some honey over soft cheese. Now, you\u2019re ready to serve!", "nutrients": {}, "links": ["https://cookieandkate.com/tag/avocado/", "https://cookieandkate.com/category/vegetarian-mexican-recipes/",
