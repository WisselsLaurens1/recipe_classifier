Add a pinch of salt, and use a fork to mash the avocado until it\u2019s pretty smooth and easily spreadable. Taste, and add more salt if necessary.\nSpread avocado on top of both slices of bread. Spread coconut bacon heavily on one piece of toast, and lightly press it into the avocado to help it stick.\nSlice the tomato into \u00bd\u2033 thick slices. Top the bacon-covered toast with 2 to 3 slices of tomato, and sprinkle it with black pepper. Top the tomato with lettuce, and place the remaining slice of bread on top, avocado side down. If you prefer, carefully slice the sandwich in half with a serrated knife.", "nutrients": {"servingSize": "1 sandwich", "calories": "637", "sugarContent": "19.1 g", "sodiumContent": "993.9 mg",
