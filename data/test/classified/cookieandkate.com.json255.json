Rinse and drain the berries and pick through to remove any stems still attached. If you\u2019re using strawberries, slice them into \u00bc-inch thick pieces. If you\u2019re using particularly large blackberries, slice them in half.\nIn a 9 by 9-inch baking dish, mix together the berries, honey, starch, citrus zest and juice. Set aside.\nIn a medium mixing bowl, stir together the oats, almond meal/flour, sliced almonds (if using), sugar and salt. Mix in the butter and yogurt. Stir until all of the flour is incorporated and the mixture is moistened throughout.\nDollop spoonfuls of the oat mixture over the filling and use your fingers to break up the mixture until it is evenly distributed (no need to pack it down).\nBake for 40 to 50 minutes, or until the filling is actively bubbling around the edges and the top is lightly golden. Let the crisp rest for 5 to 10 minutes before serving. Serve with vanilla ice cream (I insist!).", "nutrients": {"servingSize": "1 of 8 servings (no ice cream)", "calories": "333", "sugarContent": "27.7 g", "sodiumContent": "83.6 mg", "fatContent": "12.7
