Pour the idli batter in a glass bowl. Add a little water in it and mix well. Make sure that the consistency of batter is neither too thick nor too thin.\nNow, the idli batter needs to be well fermented. This step is very important to get soft and fluffy idlis. Keep the batter in a warm place to ferment. Once the batter has risen, add one pinch salt to the batter and whisk the batter to mix it well.\nGrease the idli stand with oil and take a ladleful of batter and fill the idli mould. Add \u00bd cup of water in the idli steamer and let it boil. Put the idli stand inside and close the lid. Let the steam build for 8-10 minutes before switching off the gas.\nIf you are using a cooker, use it without a vent and steam it for 10 minutes and then switch the gas off. In both cases, wait till the steam is released before you take the idli stand out. Wait for another 5 minutes and then use a sharp knife to scoop the idlis out. Transfer them on a dish plate and allow them to cool.\nNow add little water in the tempura batter and mix well. Coat the idlis with this batter. Now take a deep-bottomed pan and heat oil in it over high flame. Once the oil is sufficiently hot, fry idlis in it in batches.\nNow beat curd in a bowl and add little sugar, roasted cumin and salt in it. Then in a serving plate, spread fried idlis after cooling and pour beaten curd. Sprinkle boondi, chopped coriander, mint chutney, tamarind chutney and fresh pomegranate seeds. Idli chaat is ready to be served!", "nutrients": {"servingSize": "1 bowl", "calories": "350 cal"}, "links": ["https://recipes.timesofindia.com/beverage/cocktails/bloodhound/rs56036742.cms",
