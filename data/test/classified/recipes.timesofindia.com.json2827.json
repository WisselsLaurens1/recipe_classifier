Puree raspberries in a food processor until smooth. Pass through a fine sieve in a large bowl to discard the seeds.\nMeasure 1 cup raspberry puree, whisk in icing sugar or confectioners sugar, cover and set aside in the refrigerator as the sauce.\nPlace orange juice in a small saucepan then sprinkle in the unflavoured gelatin. Let it soften for about a minute constantly stirring over low flame until the gelatin completely dissolves. Let it stand for 5 minutes.\nMeanwhile, beat the reconstituted egg whites in a large mixing bowl with an electric mixer until soft peaks form. Gradually add in the icing sugar while constantly beating until the meringue is stiff and glossy.\nBeat the cream in the chilled bowl (see first step) until soft peaks form. Add the melted gelatin to the remaining raspberry puree and whisk until its completely blended.\nSet the bowl over a bowl of ice water and stir for about 5 to 10 minutes just until the mixture starts to thicken slightly. Add one fourth of the meringue to the raspberry puree and whisk until blended.\nUsing a whisk, fold in the remaining meringue then fold in the whipped cream. Scrape the mousse into a 6-cup metal bowl (or other decorative mould). Cover it with a plastic wrap and foil. Freeze until firm, at least for 6 hours.\nTo serve, fill a bowl or basin (large enough to hold the mold comfortably) with very hot water. Run a knife around the edges of the mold. Quickly dip the molud in hot water then invert a serving platter over the top. Grasping the mold and platter, jerk downward several times.\nIf the mousse does not release, dip in hot water again and repeat. Cut the mousse into wedges or slices. Serve with the reserved raspberry sauce and garnish each serving with a scattering of mixed berries and a mint sprig.", "nutrients": {"servingSize": "1 bowl", "calories": "291 cal"}, "links":
