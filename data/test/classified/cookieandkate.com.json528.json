Add 1 teaspoon of the salt and bring the mixture to a simmer over medium-high heat. Reduce the heat and simmer, uncovered, until the potatoes are tender (in other words, it\u2019s easy to slide a fork in and out), about 9 to 12 minutes.\nDrain well, then return the potatoes to the pot. Mash the sweet potatoes to your desired consistency.\nPromptly add almost all of the green onion and parsley, reserving a small amount of each for garnish. Add the garlic, and stir to combine. Then stir in most of the sour cream (reserve roughly 1 tablespoon for garnish), all of the butter, and the remaining 1 teaspoon salt. Season to taste with additional salt (I usually add another \u00bc to \u00bd teaspoon) and freshly ground black pepper.\nTransfer the mashed potatoes to a serving bowl and swirl the reserved sour cream onto the top with a spoon. Sprinkle with the reserved green onion and parsley, drizzle the top lightly with olive oil, and finish with a sprinkle of pepper.\nServe promptly. Leftovers will keep well, covered and refrigerated, for 3 to 4 days.", "nutrients": {"servingSize": "1 side serving", "calories": "338", "sugarContent": "12.9 g", "sodiumContent": "660.8 mg",
