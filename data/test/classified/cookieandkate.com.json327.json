I\u2019m partial to Trader Joe\u2019s sun-dried tomatoes that come in a bag because they aren\u2019t oily but they\u2019re soft enough to eat right out of the bag. You could also use oil-packed sun-dried tomatoes, rinsed and patted dry. If you\u2019re using tough, dried tomatoes, you\u2019ll need to soak them in boiling water until they\u2019re pliable, then pat them dry and continue with the recipe.\nTo make the croutons, preheat the oven to 400 degrees with a rack in the top of the oven. Line a baking sheet with parchment paper. Mix the olive oil, Parmesan and salt in a large mixing bowl until a paste is formed. Add the cubed bread and mix well with a spatula, until all the bread is coated. Turn the bread onto the prepared baking sheet and arrange in a single layer. I couldn\u2019t quite mix in all of my Parmesan mixture, so I sort of lumped the excess on top of the bread pieces. Bake for 10 minutes, then stir and put the croutons back into the oven until they are golden brown and crisp, up to 5 more minutes.\nTo make the dressing, combine the sun-dried tomatoes, Parmesan, lemon juice, water, garlic and a pinch of salt in a food processor or high-powered blender. Process for 1 minute, stopping to scrape down the sides if necessary. While running the machine, drizzle in the olive oil and blend for 10 more seconds. Don\u2019t worry if it\u2019s not perfectly smooth; it will still taste delicious! Taste and add more salt and some black pepper, if desired. Set aside.\nTo assemble the salad, drizzle the dressing over your halved romaine or toss with your chopped romaine. Finish with croutons and a sprinkle of Parmesan and sun-dried tomatoes. Serve immediately.", "nutrients": {}, "links": ["https://cookieandkate.com/tag/avocado/", "https://cookieandkate.com#comment-251837", "https://cookieandkate.com/category/vegetarian-mexican-recipes/",
