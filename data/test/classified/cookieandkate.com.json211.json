Beat the cream cheese and butter together until they are fully blended.\nAdd the powdered sugar and vanilla, then stir the mixture with a spoon until the powdered sugar is incorporated (or else powdered sugar will fly everywhere!). Finally, whip the frosting until it\u2019s nice and fluffy.\nUse the frosting immediately, or store it in the refrigerator, covered, for up to 5 days. Before using, let it warm to room temperature for about 15 minutes and briefly rewhip before using.", "nutrients": {"servingSize": "Generous 3 tablespoons", "calories": "199", "sugarContent": "19.5
