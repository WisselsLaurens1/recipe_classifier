Bring the water to a boil over medium-high heat, then reduce the heat as necessary to maintain a gentle simmer.\nCook until the farro is tender to the bite but still pleasantly chewy. Pearled farro will take around 15 minutes; unprocessed farro will take 25 to 40 minutes. Drain well.\nIf desired, stir in the olive oil and garlic while the farro is still hot. Season with additional salt, as needed. Serve as desired.", "nutrients": {"servingSize": "1/2 cup salted cooked farro", "calories": "200", "sugarContent": "0 g", "sodiumContent": "145.3 mg", "fatContent": "1.5 g", "saturatedFatContent": "0
