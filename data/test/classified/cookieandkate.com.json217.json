Butter the skillet or spray it with cooking spray.\nPlace the tortilla in the pan. Let it warm up on one side, and then flip it. Repeat if you want an extra crispy tortilla.\nOnce both sides are hot, sprinkle cheese onto the tortilla. I like to leave the center alone and cover the perimeter with cheese.\nOnce the cheese has melted, slowly pour the egg mixture onto the center of the tortilla. It will overflow onto the pan, which is fine. At this point, you\u2019re going to treat it sort of like an omelet, so use a wooden spoon to push the eggs around the perimeter of the pan. Scoot the set pieces to the center of the tortilla.\nOnce you\u2019ve redistributed all of the eggs to the tortilla, use a big spatula to flip it over and cook for about twenty seconds. Flip it back onto your plate and top it with whatever your heart desires!", "nutrients": {"servingSize": "1 serving without additional toppings", "calories": "244", "sugarContent": "1.3 g",
