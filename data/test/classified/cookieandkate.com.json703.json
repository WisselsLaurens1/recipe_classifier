Feel free to substitute white whole wheat flour or whole wheat pastry flour for the whole wheat flour and/or whole wheat pastry flour for the all-purpose flour.\nPreheat the oven to 500 degrees. Grease a 12-inch cast iron skillet with olive oil. Lightly dust your hands with flour and fold the dough over a few times, then divide the dough in half. Place one half of the dough in the skillet and gently spread it out over the surface of the pan and up the sides. Try not to break the dough, but spread it out as evenly and thinly as possible. Brush on some olive oil.\nTop the dough with half of your sauce, spread evenly. Sprinkle chopped preserved lemon or lemon salt around the edges, if using. Top with half of your grated mozzarella. Bake for 10 minutes or so, until the cheese is bubbling on top.\nRemove from the oven and transfer to a cutting board using a big spatula. Give it a few minutes to rest, then top with arugula, fresh parmesan shavings, and big sprinkle of lemon juice. Slice and serve with red pepper flakes and black pepper on the side.", "nutrients": {"servingSize": "", "calories": "325", "sugarContent": "1.6 g", "sodiumContent": "876.3 mg", "fatContent": "18.7 g",
