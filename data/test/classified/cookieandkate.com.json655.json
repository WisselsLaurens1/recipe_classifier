In a food processor or high-powered blender, combine all of the sauce ingredients. Blend until smooth. If you taste the sauce now, you may find by the raw onion flavor overpowering. Don\u2019t worry, it will mellow out thanks to the lime and after spending time in the oven.\nIn a medium skillet over medium heat, add the olive oil and chopped onion. Saut\u00e9 for a few minutes, until the onion starts to turn translucent and starts lightly browning around the edges. Add the frozen spinach and corn and cook until warmed through and the juices have mostly evaporated. Add the black beans and green chiles and cook until warmed through. Remove from heat and pour in \u00bd cup enchilada sauce and feta cheese. Mix and add salt and pepper to taste.\nGently warm the tortillas so they don\u2019t break when you roll them. The easiest way to do this is to place them in a stack in the microwave under a damp paper towel and microwave for about 60 seconds. Leave the paper towel on top to keep them warm as you roll. Working one at a time, lump a scant \u00bd cup filling down the middle of each tortilla and roll snugly. Place it with the seam side down in your baking dish. Repeat with the remaining tortillas, placing each rolled enchilada snugly next to the other until you have used up all your tortillas.\nPour the enchilada sauce down the middle of your row of enchiladas and give the pan some little shakes to help distribute it. Sprinkle the Jack cheese down the middle. Bake the enchiladas for 20 to 25 minutes, until the cheese is melted, the enchiladas are warmed through and the top of the tortillas are just crisp. Let the enchiladas cool for five minutes, during which you can pit, peel and dice the avocados. Combine them in a bowl with chopped cilantro and toss with a big squeeze of lime juice. Divide the enchiladas onto plates, top with a healthy amount of the avocado mix and serve.", "nutrients": {}, "links": ["https://cookieandkate.com#comment-25746",
