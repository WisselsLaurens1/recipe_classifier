Scrub the beets well with a vegetable brush under running water (no need to peel them at any point).\nUsing a sharp chef\u2019s knife, slice off the base of each beet to create a flat surface, and slice off the skinny pointy ends as well. Place each beet with its flat side against the cutting board and slice the beets in half, then slice the beets into wedges of even thickness, about \u00bd to \u00be-inch thick on the widest edge.\nPlace the beet wedges on the prepared baking sheet. Drizzle the beets with the olive oil and sprinkle with the salt. Toss until the beets are evenly coated, then arrange them in a single layer across the pan.\nRoast for 35 to 40 minutes, tossing halfway, until you\u2019re able to pierce through the beets with a fork with light pressure.\nMeanwhile, prep the remaining ingredients and whisk together the dressing: In a liquid measuring cup or bowl, combine the olive oil, vinegar, honey, mustard and salt. Season generously with black pepper and whisk until fully blended. Taste, and add more pepper to make it nicely peppery. Set aside.\nTo assemble the salad, place the arugula in a large serving bowl or platter. Scatter the roasted beets on top, followed by the crumbled goat cheese, chopped pistachios, radishes and green onion.\nWhen you\u2019re ready to serve, drizzle the dressing over the salad (you might not need all of it) and gently toss to coat. If you\u2019re planning for leftovers, dress individual servings as needed instead, and store the salad and dressing separately in the fridge for up to 4 days.", "nutrients": {"servingSize": "1 of 4
