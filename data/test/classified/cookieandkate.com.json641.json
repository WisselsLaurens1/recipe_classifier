Transfer the pepitas to a small bowl to cool.\nMake the dressing: In a cup or jar, whisk together the olive oil, vinegar, honey, mustard and salt until well blended. Season to taste with pepper.\nJust before serving, chop the apple into thin, bite-sized pieces. Place your greens in a large serving bowl. Top with sliced apple, dried cranberries and toasted pepitas. Use a fork to crumble the goat cheese over the salad.\nDrizzle the salad with just enough dressing to lightly coat the leaves once tossed (you probably won\u2019t need all of it). Gently toss to mix all of the ingredients and serve!", "nutrients": {}, "links": ["https://cookieandkate.com/tag/avocado/", "https://cookieandkate.com/category/vegetarian-mexican-recipes/",
