In a medium-sized pot, combine the rinsed quinoa and 1 \u00bd cups water. Bring the mixture to a gentle boil over medium heat, then reduce the heat to medium-low and gently simmer the quinoa until it has absorbed all of the water. Remove the quinoa from heat, cover the pot and let it rest for 5 minutes. Uncover the pot and fluff the quinoa with a fork. Set it aside to cool. (Here\u2019s how to cook millet.)\nMeanwhile, make the peanut sauce: Whisk together the peanut butter and tamari until smooth (if this is difficult, microwave the mixture for up to 30 seconds to loosen it up). Add the remaining ingredients and whisk until smooth. If the mixture seems too thick to toss into the salad, whisk in a bit of water to loosen it up (I didn\u2019t need to do this).\nIn a large serving bowl, combine the cooked quinoa, shredded cabbage, carrot, snow peas, cilantro and green onion. Toss to combine, then pour in the peanut sauce. Toss again until everything it lightly coated in sauce. Taste, and if it doesn\u2019t taste quite amazing yet, add a pinch of salt and toss again. Divide into individual bowls and garnish with peanuts.\nThis salad keeps well, covered and refrigerated, for about 4 days. If you don\u2019t want your chopped peanuts to get soggy, store them separately from the rest and garnish just before serving.", "nutrients": {"servingSize": "1 salad", "calories": "336",
