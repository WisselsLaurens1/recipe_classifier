Blend until the mixture is smooth and creamy, stopping to scrape down the sides as necessary. If you\u2019re having trouble blending the mixture, or would prefer a thinner consistency, slowly blend in up to \u00bd cup additional water, as needed.\nTaste and add an additional teaspoon of lemon juice if you would like more tang, or additional salt if a more intense flavor is desired. Serve immediately or chill the sour cream for later.\nLeftovers keep well, chilled, for about 5 days. The sour cream will thicken up a bit more as it rests; you can thin it by whisking in a small amount of water later, if necessary.", "nutrients": {"servingSize": "2 tablespoons", "calories": "99",
