Add the corn and \u00bd teaspoon of the salt. Cook, stirring every minute or so, until the corn is turning golden on the edges, about 5 to 7 minutes (be careful, sometimes it hops out of the pan when it\u2019s hot).\nTurn the heat down to medium-low. Add the onion, poblano, bell pepper, jalape\u00f1o (if using) and the remaining \u00bd teaspoon salt. Stir to combine, scraping up any browned bits on the bottom of the pan as best you can. Cook, stirring often, until the onion is tender and turning translucent, about 5 to 8 minutes.\nAdd the garlic to the pan, stir to combine, and cook until fragrant, about 30 seconds. Add the lima beans and cook until they\u2019re warmed through, about 2 minutes.\nAdd the butter to the skillet and stir until it\u2019s mostly melted. Remove the skillet from the heat. Let it cool for a few minutes. Taste, and season with freshly ground black pepper. Add a tiny pinch of cayenne pepper if you\u2019d like it to have more of a spicy kick. Stir in about half of the basil, reserving the rest for garnish.\nTransfer the succotash to a serving plate, if desired. Top with the remaining basil and all of the green onion. Add a few more pats of butter and sprinkle it lightly with some flaky salt or kosher salt. Serve soon. This dish is best enjoyed within a couple of hours after making, but it will keep well in the refrigerator, covered, for up to 4 days.", "nutrients": {}, "links":
