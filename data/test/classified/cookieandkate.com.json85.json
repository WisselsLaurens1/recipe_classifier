Steep the tea in the hot water for 3 minutes, then remove the bags (or strain off the loose tea). Set the tea aside to cool to room temperature, about 20 minutes.\nTo make the honey syrup: Combine equal parts honey and water (say, 2 tablespoons each if you\u2019re only making one batch of drinks) in a microwave-safe bowl or small saucepan. Warm in the microwave or over the stovetop just until you can completely stir the honey into the water. Set aside.\nWhen you\u2019re ready to serve, fill four medium glasses with ice. Fill each halfway with hibiscus tea. Top each with about a tablespoon of lime juice and 1 teaspoon of the honey simple syrup, and stir to combine. Fill the rest of each glass with sparkling water, gently stirring afterward to combine. You may want to adjust to taste by using less lime juice or more simple syrup\u2014totally up to you! Serve promptly.", "nutrients": {"servingSize": "1 drink with 1 teaspoon honey simple syrup", "calories": "15", "sugarContent": "3.1 g", "sodiumContent": "0.4 mg", "fatContent": "0 g",
