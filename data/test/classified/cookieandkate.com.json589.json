Add the soba noodles and cook according to the instructions on the package. Drain and rinse with cold water. (Tip: soba noodles seem to be more finicky than regular whole wheat pasta, so really, you need to cook them in a lot of water, be sure not to overcook them, and rinse them immediately.)\nSaut\u00e9 your broccoli and red peppers over medium high heat with a splash of vegetable oil for about 5 minutes.\nWhisk together the sauce, adding the hot water in increments at the end. As Heidi put it, you want it to be the consistency of a thin yogurt.\nOnce your noodles are done cooking, rinsed and drained, toss together the noodles, broccoli, red peppers, cilantro, green onions and sauce.\nPortion into small bowls and top with a sprinkling of dry roasted peanuts.", "nutrients": {"servingSize": "1 bowl", "calories": "503", "sugarContent": "4.8 g", "sodiumContent": "745.4 mg",
