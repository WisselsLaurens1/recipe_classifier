For easy cleanup, line a large, rimmed baking sheet with parchment paper (I was out, so I did not and it was fine).\nIn a large mixing bowl, combine the oats, almonds, coconut, salt and cinnamon. Mix well. Pour in the maple syrup, coconut oil and vanilla extract and mix well. Do NOT add the chocolate chips; we\u2019re saving those for later.\nPour the mixture onto your baking sheet and bake until the oats and coconut flakes are lightly golden and fragrant, tossing halfway, about 15 minutes.\nLet the muesli cool completely before mixing in the chocolate chips (if you add them too soon, the chips will melt and you\u2019ll have a delicious mess of chocolatey muesli). Serve individual portions in bowls with almond milk or yogurt. I like to let my muesli rest for a few minutes so the oats soften up a bit. Enjoy!\nStore cooled muesli in a freezer-safe bag with the air squeezed out. It keeps best in the freezer (no defrosting time required).", "nutrients": {"servingSize": "1/2 cup", "calories": "326", "sugarContent": "3.7 g", "sodiumContent": "169.7 mg", "fatContent": "15.9 g",
