In a mortar and pestle pound together the ginger and garlic. Now, in a separate bowl, add lemon juice along with the ginger garlic paste and stir well. Marinate these cauliflower florets in this bowl and set aside.\nNow, soak the basmati rice in water for sometime. Meanwhile, warm the milk on a pan over medium flame. Soak the saffron strands in it and keep it aside. Now, prepare the biryani masala by grinding green cardamoms, cinnamon stick, black cumin seeds, cloves and peppercorns together.\nPlace a pan over medium flame and fry the chopped onion slices till they become dark brown in color. Add these fried onions to the marinated cauliflower florets. Also, add hung curd, green chili powder, salt, red chili powder, turmeric powder, coriander powder and ghee to the same bowl making sure the cauliflower florets have an even coating of this marination paste. Keep it aside for sometime.\nNow in a deep bottomed pan, pour water along with rice, mint leaves and salt over medium flame. Once it starts boiling, switch the gas flame to low and cook for not more than 5-7 minutes. Meanwhile, start kneading the dough by mixing flour and water together. Once you have a dough, keep it on the side.\nNow, take a deep bottomed biryani pot and place it over a medium flame. Add oil to it and once its hot enough, put the marinated cauliflower florets in it. Let them cook for sometime. Meanwhile, heat a cup of water in a microwave for a minute and then pour this on top of it. Now, add some of the boiled rice to this pot. After sometime, add the left over rice as well.\nIn the same pot, add some more oil along with the saffron milk prepared in the second step in a swirl so that it spreads evenly. Cover it with a lid and cook it on full flame. Seal this pot from all the sides using the dough prepared above. After sometime, touch the lid with the side of your fingers. If its very hot, switch the flame to medium and then after 6-7 minutes turn it to low.\nAfter 10-15 minutes, take this pot off the heat. Your Hydrabadi Gobhi Mussalam Biryani is now ready. Open it only after 30 minutes and serve immediately. Dont forget to garnish it with coriander leaves on the top and enjoy.", "nutrients": {"servingSize": "1 bowl", "calories": "745 cal"}, "links":
