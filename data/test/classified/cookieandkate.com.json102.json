Thoroughly rinse the rice in a fine mesh colander under running water.\nAdd the rinsed rice and continue cooking, reducing heat as necessary to maintain an active simmer, for 40 minutes to 55 minutes. It\u2019s done when the rice is pleasantly tender but still offers a light resistance to the bite. If you see any grains bursting open down the center seam (like a hot dog bun), it\u2019s likely done.\nDrain the rice and return the rice to the pot (off the heat). Stir in any seasonings you\u2019d like to add. If you have the time, place a tea towel over the pot, cover, and let it rest for 10 minutes (this absorbs any excess moisture).
