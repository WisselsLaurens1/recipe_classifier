Now, filter the almond flour and powdered sugar together through a bottom mesh sieve. This step is undertaken so that the almond flour is combined evenly and smooth texture is formed. Set it aside.\nIn the next step, beat the egg whites in a clean medium mixing bowl. Continue beating on low speed until it starts being foamy. Increase the speed to medium while adding the cream of tartar. Now add one tablespoon of sugar at a time and start beating on high speed until you observe a hard peak. You can add the desired amount of food colour if you wish to.\nNext, sift the almond flour onto the whipped egg whites and start stirring with the help of a spatula. Continue till incorporated and a proper batter is formed. Remember not to over-stir it.\nPour the entire batter into a round tip pastry bag. On a baking paper, pipe the rounds of approximately 1.5 inch. All the rounds should be piped an inch apart. Make sure that there are no air bubbles by tapping on the baking sheets vigorously.\nLet sit the macaroons on the counter for about 15 to 30 minutes before baking. Slightly touch the rounds, if the batter does not stick to your finger, it is ready to be baked into the oven. Meanwhile, preheat your oven to 150 degrees Celsius. With one baking sheet at a time, bake the macaroons for about 18 to 20 minutes. The macaroons are cooked if they easily come out of the sheet. Keep the macaroons on a wire stack to cool them completely.\nFor the buttercream filling, take another mixing bowl and beat in the egg yolks and sugar and whisk them until the sugar dissolves. Now pour the milk and stir again. Now, taking a saucepan, transfer the egg yolk and milk mixture into it and heat them on a low flame. Cook until the mixture becomes as thick like a pudding, that is, for about 5 minutes or so. Let it cool down to room temperature. Stir the butter in 3 parts, one at a time and add vanilla essence to it.\nTake another pastry bag, and pour in the egg yolk mixture. Sandwich the macaroons with the cream filling. Serve them fresh.", "nutrients": {"servingSize": "1 bowl", "calories": "620 cal"}, "links": ["https://recipes.timesofindia.com/beverage/cocktails/bloodhound/rs56036742.cms",
