Spread the almonds across a large, rimmed baking sheet and toast the almonds for 10 minutes, stirring halfway.\nLet the almonds cool until they\u2019re just warm (not hot), about 10 minutes.\nTransfer the almonds to a high-speed blender or food processor. Blend until creamy, pausing to scrape down the sides as necessary. You\u2019re going to think it\u2019ll never blend, but be patient! The almonds will go from flour-like clumps, to a ball against the side of the food processor (keep scraping down the sides and breaking up the ball), and finally, it will turn lusciously creamy. If the mixture gets crazy hot along the way, stop and let it cool for a few minutes.\nOnce the almond butter is very smooth and creamy (no sooner!), you can blend in any add-ins you would like. I always add salt, for more flavor overall. You can also add cinnamon for a hint of spice, and vanilla and/or maple syrup for almond butter that tastes more special than store-bought.\nBlend until the add-ins are evenly dispersed. When I added maple syrup, I had to let the mixture cool, and then blend a few additional minutes, to make it creamy again.\nLet the almond butter cool to room temperature, then transfer the mixture to a mason jar and screw on the lid. Store in the refrigerator for up to 2 weeks, or until you see or smell any signs of spoilage.", "nutrients": {"servingSize": "2 tablespoons of salted almond butter (no additional flavorings)",
