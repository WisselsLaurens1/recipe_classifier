Turn each portion into a ball using your hands.\nNext, to prepare the filling, heat oil and butter together in a frying pan over medium flame. Add onions along with garlic in the pan and saute until they are translucent. Then, add finely chopped ginger along with green chillies and stir to mix well with the onions. Finally, add the minced lamb and salt in the pan and stir-fry until cooked, for about at least 7-8 minutes and sprinkle a little amount of water, if necessary, to prevent sticking to the bottom.\nNow, add Tabasco sauce, lemon juice, black pepper powder and salt in the lamb mix, and stir to mix well. Remove the pan from heat and adjust the seasoning and let it cool at room temperature. Add cheddar cheese over the filliing, mix it well and divide this filling as well into 16 equal portions.\nFlatten the potato balls between the palms and shape it into round patties and place the portions of the filling in the middle to prepare the patty. Seal it and in a similar way make other patties as well (ensure that that the filling does not ooze out). Refrigerate for 15 minutes to set the patty.\nRemove the patties from the refrigerator, dip in the bowl of beaten eggs and then roll them in the breadcrumbs. Keep aside.\nPut another frying pan over high flame and heat oil in it. When the oil is hot enough, lower the flame and add patties (in convenient batches) and shallow fry them until they are golden brown in colour. Once fried, add them to an absorbent paper to soak the extra oil. Garnish with coriander leaves and serve them hot with spicy tomato chutney and enjoy!", "nutrients": {"servingSize": "1 bowl", "calories": "691 cal"}, "links":
