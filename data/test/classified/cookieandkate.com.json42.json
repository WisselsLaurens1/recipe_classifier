Add the corn, potatoes, onion, poblano, bell pepper, celery, \u00bd teaspoon of the salt, and \u00bd teaspoon chili powder. Stir to combine. Cook until the onions are tender and translucent, about 7 to 10 minutes, stirring every couple of minutes.\nAdd the garlic and cook until fragrant, about 30 seconds to 1 minute, while stirring constantly. Add the broth and water and stir to combine. Drop in the bay leaf.\nBring the mixture to a boil over high heat, then reduce the heat as necessary to maintain a gentle simmer. Simmer for 20 to 25 minutes, stirring occasionally. It\u2019s not done until the potatoes are fully cooked through and very easily pierced through with a fork.\nRemove the pot from the heat. Using kitchen tongs, remove the bay leaf. Carefully transfer about 3 cups of the soup (about half liquid, half solids) to a blender. Securely fasten the lid and be careful to avoid the hot steam as you blend until completely smooth. Add the butter and blend again.\nPour the mixture back into the pot. Add the cilantro, cr\u00e8me fra\u00eeche (see note if using sour cream or Greek yogurt) and lime juice. Stir to combine. Season with the remaining \u00bc teaspoon salt and be generous with the black pepper, to taste. If you\u2019d like more spice, add up to \u00bd teaspoon more chili powder, to taste.\nDivide the chowder into bowls and top with garnishes of your choice. Leftover chowder will keep well in the refrigerator, covered, for up to 5 days or for several months frozen.", "nutrients": {"servingSize": "1 of 4 large bowls, no garnishes", "calories": "513",
