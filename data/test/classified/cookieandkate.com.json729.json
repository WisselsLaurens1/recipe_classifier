Line one large, rimmed baking sheet and one smaller sheet with parchment paper. Place the spinach, cilantro, jalape\u00f1o, shallot, garlic, salt and \u00bd cup of the vegetable broth in a food processor or blender. Blend until smooth.\nHeat the oil in a heavy-bottomed pot over medium heat until shimmering. Add the rice and stir to coat. Spread the rice in an even layer on the bottom of the pot and let the rice lightly brown. This happens quickly! When the rice starts to brown, stir it and spread it out in an even layer again so that more of the rice browns.\nWhen most of the rice has lightly browned, scrape the green pur\u00e9e into the rice. Stir until the rice is evenly coated with green pur\u00e9e and continue to cook, stirring constantly, for a minute. Add the rest of the vegetable broth to the pot. Bring to a boil, then reduce the heat to a low simmer and cover the pot. Cook the rice on a very low simmer until tender, 35 to 40 minutes.\nWhile the rice cooks, toss the sweet potatoes in the olive oil, smoked paprika and salt until the sweet potatoes are evenly coated in oil. Arrange in a single layer on your prepared baking sheet. Bake for 35 to 40 minutes, tossing halfway, until the sweet potatoes are tender and caramelizing at the edges.\nMeanwhile, transfer the beans and their cooking liquid (don\u2019t drain the beans) to a medium pot. Stir in the cumin and chili powder and warm over medium heat. Once the beans are simmering, cover the beans and reduce heat to maintain a very gentle simmer until you\u2019re ready to serve.\nOnce the rice is done cooking, remove the pot from heat. Uncover the pot and place a clean tea towel over the pot, then recover. The towel will help absorb excess liquid as the rice continues to cook in its own steam. (If you don\u2019t have a clean towel, you can skip this step, just cover normally.) Let sit for 10 minutes.\nOnce the sweet potatoes are done cooking, toss the pepitas with \u00bc teaspoon olive oil and a sprinkle of salt on the small baking sheet. Toast the seeds in the oven for 4 to 5 minutes, until they\u2019re turning lightly golden and making little popping noises. Set aside to cool.\nFluff the rice with a fork and season with salt if necessary. Remove beans from heat, stir in the vinegar and season to taste with salt and pepper.\nAssemble your bowls: First add green rice, then use a slotted spoon or fork to transfer beans to the bowls. Top with sweet potatoes and add a few slices of avocado to each bowl. Sprinkle with toasted pepitas and cilantro and optional feta. Serve with salsa verde on the side.", "nutrients": {}, "links": ["https://cookieandkate.com/tag/avocado/", "https://cookieandkate.com/category/vegetarian-mexican-recipes/",
