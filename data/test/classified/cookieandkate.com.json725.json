Rinse them and pat them dry.\nHeat an empty Dutch oven or soup pot over medium heat until a few drops of water evaporate quickly from the pan. Toast the chilis in the dry pan, pressing them flat with a spatula for a few seconds until fragrant, then flip them over and press them again for a few seconds. Remove the toasted chilis and set them aside for now.\nIn the same pot (still over medium heat), warm the olive oil until shimmering. Add the onion and a pinch of salt. Cook, stirring often, until the onions are tender and translucent, about 5 minutes. Add the garlic and cumin and cook until fragrant while stirring, about 1 minute. Add the tomato paste and cook, while stirring, for 1 minute.\nAdd the toasted chili peppers, bay leaf, hominy, beans, vegetable broth and water to the pot. Stir in \u00bd teaspoon salt and raise the heat to medium-high. Bring the mixture to a simmer, then reduce heat as necessary to maintain a gentle simmer, stirring occasionally, and cook for 25 minutes.\nRemove the chili peppers and bay leaf from the soup and discard them. Stir the cilantro and juice of \u00bd lime into the soup. Taste, and add more salt (I usually add at least \u00bc teaspoon more) and/or lime juice if necessary. For extra richness, add a little splash of olive oil and stir it in.\nCut the remaining lime into small wedges. Divide the soup into bowls and garnish with lime wedges and other garnishes of your choice.", "nutrients": {"servingSize": "1 large bowl, without garnishes", "calories": "382", "sugarContent": "5.5
