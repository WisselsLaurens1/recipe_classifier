Once they are soaked, drain the extra water and keep the bowl aside.\nTo the soaked chickpeas, sprinkle corn flour, a bit of red chilli powder and salt over them so that they are covered completely. Freeze these choley for 15-20 minutes so that they turn white in colour.\nTake a small bowl of water and add tomato ketchup in it along with Schezwan sauce, green chilli sauce, soy sauce and a spoon of corn flour and salt as per taste. Mix well all the ingredients and make sure that the quantity of water must be such that the dish remains semi gravy.\nPut a kadhai on medium flame and heat oil in it. When the oil is hot enough, add the frozen chickpeas in it and deep fry them until they are crispy. Once done, transfer them to an absorbent paper, which will soak the extra oil.\nNow, put a frying pan on medium flame and add 2-3 teaspoons of oil in it. When the oil is hot enough, add chopped onions in it and saute them till they are brown in colour. Once they are sauteed, add onion wedges in it along with sliced green chillies, ginger and garlic. Stir and saute them well on high flame. Once they are also done, add chopped capsicum and carrot in the pan.\nOnce all veggies are done, add the mixture of all sauces made in bowl and bring it to a boil. Then, add a pinch of salt and mix once again. Make sure that not much salt is added at this point as the fried chickpeas already have salt in them.\nIn the end, add fried chickpeas and spring onions in the pan and give them a nice stir. Mix them for 2 minutes and serve hot.", "nutrients": {"servingSize": "1 bowl", "calories": "372 cal"}, "links": ["https://recipes.timesofindia.com/beverage/cocktails/bloodhound/rs56036742.cms",
