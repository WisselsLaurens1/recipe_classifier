First, wash and rinse both types of rice and lentils(urad dal) together under running water properly. Then, transfer them to a large sized bowl and add fenugreek seeds in it. Cover the bowl and let it set overnight.\nNext morning, transfer the mixture in a mixer-grinder jar. Then, pour 1/4th cup of water in it. Also add salt as required and mix gently. Now, blend the mixture on maximum speed until you get a fine paste. Then, transfer the mixture in a bowl and let it set for at least 5 hours. Once set, add spinach puree in the bowl and mix well. Now, divide the mixture in 8 equal portions.\nAfter that, take a chopping board and chop tomatoes, onions, green chilies. Then, transfer the chopped vegetables in a medium sized bowl. Next, add eggs in the bowl and whisk with the help of a blender until partially smooth. Then, divide the vegetable mixture in 4 equal portions.\nThen, take 1 small sized onion and divide it in 2 halves. Now, take 1 half of the sliced onion and tie it properly in a muslin cloth. Make sure that the flat side of the sliced onion stays smooth, tie the onion in cloth from another end. Next, take a small sized bowl and pour little amount of cooking oil in it. Dip the onion in the cooking oil and keep aside for a while.\nNext, take a griddle pan(flat dosa tawa) and place it on high flame. Once the pan is hot enough, turn the heat to low flame. Then, rub the oil immersed onion(step 4) on the griddle pan carefully from the flat side. Now, pour 1 portion of the dosa batter(step 2) over oil and spread it(6 diameter). Cook from both the sides properly for 3-4 minutes. Ensure that the dosa does not become crisp. Next, place a portion of vegetable mixture(step 3) over it. Similarly, do the same with 3 more batter portions and keep aside.\nFor the remaining 4 batter portions. Similarly, rub the oil immersed onion(step 4) on the griddle pan carefully from the flat side. Now, pour 1 portion of the remaining dosa batter portions over oil and spread it(6 diameter). Cook from both the sides properly for 3-4 minutes. Ensure that the dosa does not become crisp. Keep the 4 aside for a while.\nLastly, take a serving dish and place 1 cooked vegetable dosa(step 5) over it. Then, cover it with 1 cooked plain dosa(step 6). Sprinkle pepper and garnish with mint leaves, sliced tomatoes. You may top with butter too as per your choice. Serve warm. Similarly, do the same with remaining dosa portions.", "nutrients": {"servingSize": "1 bowl", "calories": "472 cal"}, "links":
