Transfer the squeezed cucumber to a serving bowl, and repeat with the remaining cucumber.\nAdd the yogurt, olive oil, herbs, lemon juice, garlic, and salt to the bowl, and stir to blend. Let the mixture rest for 5 minutes to allow the flavors to meld. Taste and add additional chopped fresh herbs, lemon juice, and/or salt, if necessary (I thought this batch was just right as-is).\nServe tzatziki immediately or chill for later. Leftover tzatziki keeps well, chilled, for about 4 days.", "nutrients": {"servingSize": "1/4 cup", "calories": "78", "sugarContent": "2.7 g", "sodiumContent": "154.2 mg", "fatContent": "5.4 g",
