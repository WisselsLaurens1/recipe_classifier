Then, clean and remove its neck and skin properly. Now, prick it entirely with the help of a fork and keep aside for a while.\nNext, crush the saffron threads with the help of a pestle or the back of a spoon. Then, take a medium sized bowl and pour 30 milliliter of lukewarm water in it. Now, transfer the crushed saffron in this bowl and let it rest in it for next 20 minutes. After that, blend it using a blender to make a smooth paste.\nNext, to prepare the marination, take a large sized bowl and add hung curd along with prepared saffron paste(step 2) in it. Then, add ghee, almond paste, garlic paste, ginger paste, red chilli powder, lemon juice, green cardamom powder, mace powder and rose petal water in it. Also, add salt as required and mix well. Now, transfer and rub the pricked chicken(step 1) in this prepared marination and reserve for at least an hour. You should preferably reserve the chicken overnight in refrigerator so that the flavours of the spices get infused properly.\nNow, take a large sized pot(kadhai) and place it on high flame. Then, pour the chicken stock in it. Now, neatly transfer and place the marinated chicken(step 3) in this pot. Make sure that you leave space between each of them. Now, add green cardamom, cinnamon, black cardamom, cloves and bay leaves in it. Let the stock boil completely. Once done, turn the flame to low heat and cover the pot with a lid. Let it simmer for next 20 minutes. After that, uncover the pot and stir gently until the stock liquid is completely absorbed. Then, turn of the flame and keep aside for a while.\nThen, spread 6 roomali rotis overlapping each other from their sides on a large surface like a table. Make sure that the roomali rotis are fresh, warm and moist so that they easily stick with each other from sides when overlapped. Also, they should form a diameter big enough to wrap the chicken filling in them. Now, place the prepared chicken rogan(step 4) vertically in the center. Then, properly roll and overlap the roti. It should resemble like a filled loaf, wrap or a huge roll. Once done, transfer it to a greased baking tray carefully. Take care that the filling does not come out. You may make use of little amount of maida paste to make the rotis stick easily if required.\nNow, preheat the OTG at 120 degree Celsius. Then, place the baking tray in it and bake the filled roti for 15 minutes. Then, divide it in medium sized slices and transfer them on a serving dish. Serve immediately. Similarly, do the same with remaining rotis and filling.", "nutrients": {"servingSize": "1 bowl", "calories": "389 cal"}, "links":
