Transfer the pecans to a food processor and add the broken graham crackers and pumpkin spice blend.\nProcess the mixture for about 10 seconds, until the pecans and grahams are broken into tiny pieces (you may need to break up a few persistent pieces between your fingers, to avoid turning the mixture into nut butter). Transfer the mixture to a bowl and wipe out the food processor with a clean tea towel for the next step.\nTo make the cheesecake mousse: In the food processor, combine the cream cheese (6 ounces of it), yogurt, maple syrup and vanilla extract. Blend until the mixture is completely smooth, scraping down the sides and bottom as necessary. Transfer the mixture to a bowl. It\u2019s ok if a bit of it remains in the food processor for the next step.\nTo make the pumpkin mousse: In the food processor, combine the pumpkin pur\u00e9e, yogurt, the remaining 2 ounces of cream cheese, maple syrup, pumpkin spice blend, vanilla extract, and a pinch of salt. Blend until the mixture is completely smooth, scraping down the sides and bottom as necessary.\nTo assemble, transfer about 2 ounces (\u00bc cup) of the pumpkin pur\u00e9e to each of your 8 cups. Top each with about 1 ounce (2 tablespoons) of the cream cheese mixture\u2014you might have a bit leftover; just divide it between the cups. Top each with about 1 tablespoon of the pecan and graham cracker topping.\nServe immediately, or better yet, cover and refrigerate for later (they\u2019ll thicken up somewhat over time, which I like\u2014they\u2019ll keep for up to 2 days in the fridge).", "nutrients": {"servingSize": "1 cup", "calories": "273", "sugarContent": "18.5 g", "sodiumContent": "198.3 mg", "fatContent": "15.6 g",
