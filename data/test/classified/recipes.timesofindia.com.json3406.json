Then, wash the tomatoes and finely chop them as well in another bowl. Peel the potato and dice it in a small bowl. Afterwards, wash the coriander leaves and finely chop them as well in a bowl. Peel the garlic cloves and finely chop them too. Now, wash the paneer and dice it in a plate. Also, soak cashews in 2 tbsps of warm milk. Keep all these ingredients aside until required.\nAfter chopping, put a saucepan over medium flame and heat one teaspoon ghee in it. Once the ghee is melted, add chopped onions in it and saute until they are translucent. Now, add garlic and saute for a minute. Then, add tomatoes in the pan and saute until the mixture turns mushy. To this mix, add all the spice powders, salt and saute until raw smell goes off. Turn off the stove now and let this mixture cool down. Add the soaked cashews to this mixture as well.\nOnce the mixture is cool enough to handle, grind this mixture to a smooth paste by adding it to a blender jar. Add small quantities of water in between to ensure the consistency is not that thick. Meanwhile, put the same pan again over medium flame and heat 3 teaspoons of ghee in it. Once the ghee is hot enough, add cumin seeds in it along with cinnamon stick. Saute for a few seconds and then add diced potatoes in it. Stir to mix and then add washed peas in it and saute well.\nOnce the potatoes are soft, add the ground mixture in it and mix well. Saute until ghee oozes from the mixture. Now, add water until required consistency is reached. Finally, add milk along with diced paneer in the pan and stir to mix once again all the ingredients, let the mixture simmer for about 10 minutes. Cover the pan with a lid and cook until all the ingredients are well combined.\nAfter 10 minutes of cooking all the vegetables in milk, open the lid and check if all the veggies are cooked. If not, cook for another 5 minutes and then turn off the stove. Sprinkle the crushed kasoori methi over the prepared dish along with coriander leaves and drizzle a tablespoon of the fresh cream. Stir and serve hot with jeera rice or naan/kulcha.", "nutrients": {"servingSize": "1 bowl", "calories": "528 cal"}, "links":
