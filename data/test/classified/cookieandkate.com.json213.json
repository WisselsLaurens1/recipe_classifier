In a large mixing bowl, combine the brown rice crisps and 1 cup of the chopped pecans (reserve the rest for sprinkling on top). Set both aside.\nIn a medium saucepan, combine the peanut butter and honey. Warm the mixture over medium-low heat, stirring often, until it\u2019s steaming or you catch a bubble or two forming on the bottom, about 5 minutes. (We don\u2019t want this mixture to come to a boil or the peanut butter could scorch.)\nPour the warm mixture into the bowl of rice crisps. Using a rubber or silicone spatula, stir until the mixture is completely combined. Transfer it all to the lined baking dish. Press down with the spatula to spread it fairly evenly, then switch to a large, sturdy glass with a flat bottom (maybe a working jar or mason jar or what-have-you) and press down firmly all over, including the corners. You really want to pack it down (it\u2019s ok if you hear some crunching noises). Lastly, use your hands to ensure that it\u2019s evenly compacted.\nMelt the chocolate chips in a microwave-safe bowl in 30-second increments, stirring after each one. Don\u2019t overdo it. The chocolate is done when it\u2019s about 90% melted\u2014keep stirring off the heat and the pieces should completely dissolve. (Alternately, you can use melt it in a heat-proof bowl set over a saucepan of gently simmering water.)\nPour the melted chocolate over the peanut butter-crispy mixture. Use a clean spatula to spread it evenly all over. Make some pretty chocolate swooshes if you\u2019d like. Sprinkle the remaining pecans on top, followed by the salt.\nPlace the baking dish in the refrigerator and chill for at least 2 hours, or up to a day. To slice, carefully grab both sides of the parchment paper and lift it out of the baking dish. Use a sharp chef\u2019s knife to make 4 even columns and 4 even rows\u2014to minimize the risk of cracking the chocolate, carefully apply even pressure from above the knife to press straight down, rather than sawing from one edge across.\nThese bars will keep well at room temperature for up to 1 week, or for several months in the freezer. Store in an air-tight container either way.", "nutrients": {}, "links": ["https://cookieandkate.com#comment-639975", "https://cookieandkate.com/tag/avocado/", "https://amzn.to/3au8Or7",
