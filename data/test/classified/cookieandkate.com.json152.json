Run the a\u00e7a\u00ed packets under warm water for about 10 seconds to let them thaw a bit, then cut them open and pour the a\u00e7a\u00ed pulp into the blender.\nPour in the cold water, securely fasten the lid, and start blending on the lowest speed until you can gain traction, increasing to high speed as it becomes available. If necessary, pause the blender to scrape down the sides, and add \u00bc cup to \u00bd cup more water if it just won\u2019t blend. (I used the tamper provided with my Vitamix and didn\u2019t need to add any more liquid.)\nAdd 1 to 2 tablespoons lime juice, to taste, and blend briefly to combine. Pour the smoothie into bowls and top with garnishes of your choice. Serve immediately, or cover and refrigerate for up to 3 days.", "nutrients": {"servingSize": "1 of 2 smoothie bowls, without toppings", "calories": "257", "sugarContent": "34.8 g", "sodiumContent":
