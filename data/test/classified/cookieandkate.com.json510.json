Line a large, rimmed baking sheet with parchment paper to prevent the potatoes from sticking.\nSlice the potatoes into 2-inch chunks (slice small potatoes in half, larger potatoes into quarters, and so on). Place them on the prepared baking sheet.\nDrizzle the olive oil over the potatoes, then sprinkle on the garlic powder, salt, and rosemary, if using. Toss with your hands until the potatoes are evenly coated in the mixture (it might seem like you don\u2019t have enough oil, but you do\u2014keep going!). Arrange the potatoes in an even layer across the pan with their flat edges against the pan.\nRoast the potatoes for 40 to 45 minutes, stirring halfway, until the potatoes are deeply golden (check the undersides) and easily pierced through by a fork. Stir in the parsley, if using, and season to taste with additional salt and some black pepper (careful, the potatoes are hot).
