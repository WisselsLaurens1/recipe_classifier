Cut off one-third of each pepper lengthwise (see photos). Use a small spoon (a serrated grapefruit spoon works great) to scoop out the seeds and membranes from each pepper, and discard those pieces.\nIn a bowl, combine the cream cheese, \u00bc cup chopped cilantro and green onion, garlic powder, onion powder and salt. Stir to combine.\nStuff the peppers with the cream cheese mixture (you might have a small amount left over). Top each of the peppers with a small mound of cheese lengthwise.\nBake for 10 to 13 minutes, until the cheese is bubbling and starting to turn golden.\nMeanwhile, place a big handful of chips in a food processor and process until the chips are broken into tiny pieces (or, you can crush them under a rolling pin). Stir the feta, if using, and the remaining 1 tablespoon of cilantro and green onion into the chips.\nTransfer the jalape\u00f1o poppers to a large serving dish and top each pepper with the crushed chip mixture.
