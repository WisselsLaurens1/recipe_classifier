Pour the oil into a large, heavy-bottomed pan with a lid (if you have a medium-sized Dutch oven, it\u2019s perfect for this). Turn the heat up to medium, add 2 kernels of corn, and cover.\nOnce the kernels pop, remove the lid and pour in the remaining popcorn kernels. Cover the pot and give the pot a little shimmy to distribute the kernels evenly.\nCook over medium heat, shaking the pot occasionally. Crack the lid just a smidge so the popcorn stays crisp, and cook until the popping sound slows to about one pop per every few seconds. Remove the pan from heat and dump the popcorn onto the parchment paper-covered pan. Lightly salt it and pick out any kernels that didn\u2019t pop.\nPlace the candy canes in a plastic bag. Cover the bag with a tea towel and crush the candy canes by rolling a rolling pin over it. A hammer works, too. You want the candy canes to be pretty finely crushed when you\u2019re done.\nMelt the chocolate chips over a double boiler or in the microwave in twenty-second bursts, stirring between each, until the chocolate is completely melted and smooth.\nUse a spoon to drizzle the chocolate over the popcorn. Working quickly, sprinkle the popcorn with the crushed candy canes. Lightly sprinkle with a pinch of Maldon/finishing salt or sea salt. Transfer the pan to the refrigerator for ten minutes, or until the chocolate is set completely. Break up the popcorn sheet with your hands and serve.", "nutrients": {}, "links": ["https://cookieandkate.com/perfect-stovetop-popcorn-recipe/", "https://cookieandkate.com/tag/avocado/",
