Then, pour and heat oil in it. Once the oil is hot enough, add sliced onions and saute them until they become translucent. Then, add chopped tomatoes in the pan and stir-fry them until almost all the moisture has evaporated. Next, add peeled garlic, chopped ginger and green chillies in the pan and stir for a while. Now, add coriander powder along with red chilli powder, turmeric powder, curry leaves in the pan and cook until the moisture has evaporated completely. Also, add salt as required and mix properly. Once cooked, turn the flame off and let the mixture cool.\nNow, transfer the prepared mixture to a mixer-grinder jar and add coconut milk in it. Then, blend the mixture on maximum speed until you get a smooth paste. Once done, transfer the paste to a bowl and keep aside for a while.\nNext, wash and pat dry the cottage cheese properly. Then, slice the cottage cheese into 16 equal sized chunks and keep aside for next 10 minutes.\nNow, take another medium sized bowl and add yogurt along with kairali roast masala, rice flour in it. Then, whisk properly with the help of a blender until smooth. Also, add green cardamom, nutmeg powder, lemon juice, cream in the bowl and whisk again. Next, dip the cottage cheese chunks(step 3) in the prepared batter properly. Place the mixture in refrigerator for some time.\nNext, place the dipped cottage cheese chunks on skewers(tandoor sticks) evenly. Also, place a raw onion in 1 of the skewers. Transfer the filled skewers on a baking tray. Pour the remaining batter on the top of the chunks neatly.\nThen, preheat the OTG at 135 degree Celsius(275 Fahrenheit) for 10-12 minutes. Now, place the baking tray in OTG and let the cottage cheese chunks cook for next 5-6 minutes. Once cooked properly, remove the tray from OTG.\nLastly, take a serving dish and transfer the prepared gravy(step 1and 2) in it. Then, neatly place the tandoori chunks(step 6) over the gravy. Also, sprinkle some pepper and serve hot.", "nutrients": {"servingSize": "1 bowl", "calories": "272 cal"}, "links": ["https://recipes.timesofindia.com/beverage/cocktails/bloodhound/rs56036742.cms",
