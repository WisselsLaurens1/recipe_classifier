the help of a rolling pin, flatten slightly without getting the stuffing out.\nbrush with water on one side of naan (brush water on the plain side of naan). make sure you coat uniformly. this helps naan to stick on tawa.\nfurthermore, slowly flip over and put it on hot tawa. remember, be gentle and put the water coated side down to tawa. also do not use nonstick tawa.\nslightly press. this helps the naan to stick on to the tawa and when you flip the tawa upside down it will be intact.\nnow after a minute, flip the tawa upside down and cook naan directly on flame till they turn golden brown.\ngently scrape the naan from the bottom and remove.\nif the edges are uncooked, you can directly cook over the flame.\nspread a generous amount of butter over naan and crush slightly to
