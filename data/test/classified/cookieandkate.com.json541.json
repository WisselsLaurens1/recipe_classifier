Working in batches, pulse the chunks in a food processor with the S-blade until they\u2019re broken into tiny pieces, just bigger than couscous. (See recipe notes if you don\u2019t have a food processor.)\nWrap the cauliflower rice in a clean tea towel or paper towels, twist, and squeeze as much water as possible from the rice\u2014you might be surprised by how much water you can wring out.\nToast the almonds in a large skillet over medium heat, stirring frequently (careful, or they\u2019ll burn), until they\u2019re fragrant and starting to turn golden on the edges, about 3 to 5 minutes. Transfer the toasted almonds to a bowl to cool.\nReturn the skillet to the heat and add the olive oil and garlic. Cook while stirring until the garlic is fragrant, about 10 to 20 seconds. Add the cauliflower rice, red pepper flakes and salt, and stir to combine. Cook, stirring just every minute or so, until the cauliflower rice is hot and turning golden in places, about 6 to 10 minutes.\nRemove the skillet from the heat. Stir in the toasted almonds, parsley and lemon juice. Season to taste with salt and pepper, and serve warm.", "nutrients": {}, "links": ["https://cookieandkate.com#tasty-recipes-27742-jump-target", "https://cookieandkate.com/tag/avocado/",
