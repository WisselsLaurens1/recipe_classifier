On a large, rimmed baking sheet, toss the torn pita with 2 tablespoons olive oil until lightly coated. Sprinkle with salt and bake in the oven until the pieces are very golden and crispy, tossing halfway, 8 to 12 minutes. Set the baking sheet aside to cool.\nTo prepare the salad: Make the salad dressing as directed and set aside. In a large serving bowl, combine the chopped lettuce, tomatoes, cucumber, onion, radish, mint, optional parsley and feta, and toasted pita.\nWait until you\u2019re ready to serve to drizzle up to \u00bd cup dressing over the salad. Gently toss until all of the ingredients are lightly coated in dressing. Serve promptly, and sprinkle individual servings generously with sumac.\nThis salad is best consumed soon after making, since the dressing will wilt the lettuce and soften the pita with time. If you intend to have leftovers, store the salad separately from the dressing, and toss individual salads before serving. The salad will keep this way, covered and refrigerated, for up to 4 days.", "nutrients": {"servingSize": "1 medium salad without feta or parsley (full salad made with 1/3 cup dressing)", "calories":
