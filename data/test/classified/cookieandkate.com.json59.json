See recipe notes for stovetop instructions.) Add the wild rice and water to the Instant Pot. Secure the lid and move the steam release valve to Sealing. Select Manual/Pressure Cook and cook on high pressure for 22 minutes.\nWhile the rice is cooking, in a large bowl, whisk together the olive oil, lemon juice, garlic, salt, pepper and maple syrup to make the dressing. Set aside.\nRemove the ribs from the kale and finely chop the leaves (you should have about 2 to 3 cups); add the kale to the bowl. Chop the green onions (about 1 cup) and cut the tomatoes into quarters, adding both to the bowl as you work. Seed and chop the red bell pepper and add it to the bowl. Toss the vegetables to coat well in the dressing.\nWhen the cooking cycle is complete, let the pressure naturally release for 10 minutes, then move the steam release valve to Venting to release any remaining pressure. When the floating valve drops, remove the lid and give the rice a stir.\nAdd the rice to the bowl of dressed vegetables. (If you haven\u2019t finished chopping the vegetables, you can finish as the rice cools.) Toss well to coat. Megan suggests chilling the bowl in the fridge for 30 minutes, but I was hungry and it tasted great to me, so do as you please.\nJust before serving, stir in the feta and taste and adjust the seasonings as needed, adding an extra squeeze of lemon juice to brighten the flavors. Store leftovers in an airtight container in the fridge for up to 3 days.", "nutrients": {"servingSize": "1 medium salad", "calories": "300", "sugarContent": "8.1 g", "sodiumContent": "466.3 mg",
