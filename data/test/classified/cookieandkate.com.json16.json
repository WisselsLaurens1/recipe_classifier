Line a large, rimmed baking sheet with parchment paper.\nScrub and trim the beets and slice them into wedges (about \u00bd to \u00be-inch thick on the widest edge). Toss the beets and shallots with the olive oil and season with the red pepper flakes (go easy on the flakes if you\u2019re sensitive to spice), salt and pepper. Transfer the seasoned beets and shallots to the prepared baking sheet (it\u2019s ok if they overlap) and roast for 40 to 50 minutes, until fork tender. Remove from the oven and set aside to come to room temperature.\nTo make the basil vinaigrette: In a high-powered blender or food processor, combine the shallot, basil, garlic, red pepper flakes, olive oil, red wine vinegar, and salt. Blend for 1 minute, or until very smooth. Season to taste with salt and pepper.\nSpread the labneh on a large platter, dollop with basil vinaigrette, and scatter with the beets and avocado wedges. Sprinkle with fresh mint leaves, dill, and flaky salt (don\u2019t hold back) and serve.", "nutrients": {"servingSize": "1 of 8 servings", "calories": "271", "sugarContent": "13.1 g", "sodiumContent":
