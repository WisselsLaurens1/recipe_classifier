Then shred them in a food processor using the slicing blade, pressing the sprouts against the blade with the provided plastic pusher. If you don\u2019t have a food processor, slice them as thinly as possible using a sharp chef\u2019s knife, then give them a few extra chops for good measure.\nIf you are using raw almonds, toast them over medium heat for three to four minutes, stirring frequently, until they are fragrant and turning golden on the edges.\nWhisk together the olive oil, vinegar, honey, mustard and garlic until blended. In a medium serving bowl, toss the shredded sprouts with the almonds, chopped dried fruit, Parmesan and dressing. Taste, and add another pinch or two of salt if it needs a little something more.\nServe immediately, or cover and refrigerate for up for 4 days. The Brussels sprouts will continue to soften as they marinate. The edges of the sprouts might brown lightly over time. Wake up leftovers with a little sprinkle of salt and a tiny splash of vinegar.", "nutrients": {}, "links": ["https://cookieandkate.com/tag/avocado/",
