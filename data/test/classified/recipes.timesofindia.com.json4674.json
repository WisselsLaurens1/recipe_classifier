For the same, mix together ginger-garlic paste, 4 tablespoons of yoghurt, turmeric powder and Kashmiri red chilli powder. Then, cut the chicken in pieces and marinate the chicken with this mixture. Let the chicken marinate for an hour in an enclosed bowl so that flavours are absorbed equally. Then, dice half the onions and finely chop the others. (Note: You can put the chicken in refrigerator so that it lies untouched and it is marinated well.)\nNext, put a thick-bottomed non-stick pan over medium flame and heat enough oil in it for cooking chicken. Once the oil is hot enough, add cardamom in it along with diced onions. Saute until the onions are pale brown in colour. Make sure that you are cooking the onions on low flame.\nThen, add in the cashews and cook until they are light brown in colour. This is very important, please see that cooking is done as advised or else it will not be effective in the next stage. Once done, turn off the flame. Transfer the contents in a grinding jar and let them cool. When the cashews are cool enough, grind them to a fine paste. Add the remaining yoghurt and grind once again. Keep this aside until required.\nPut a non-stick pan on medium flame and heat a little oil in it. Quickly, add the diced onion till they become brownish. Get all the cooked onion out the pan and keep them separately.\nIn the same pan, add bay leaf along with the whole red chilli. Saute for a few seconds and then add cloves and cinnamon stick in it. Saute for another few seconds and then add the onion-cashew paste in it, cook for a minute on low flame. Finally, add brown sugar and salt along with cumin and coriander powder. Mix well all the ingredients and cook the cashew-onion paste for a minute. Then, add 1/2 cup of water in the pan and let the gravy cook for 3-5 minutes.\nNow, add the the marinated chicken in the pan along with all the mixtures. Cook the chicken on medium flame for about 30 minutes. Cover the pan with a lid so that the chicken absorbs all the flavours of the spices. Stir in between so that the chicken doesnt stick to the bottom and make sure you do not add water in the chicken, as it will release a little water. Just make sure that the chicken juice is being soaked well and the flavours are being absorbed by the chicken. If you need a little water to add, add only a bit and do not overcook the chicken.\nFinally, when the chicken is about to get done, add 1 tablespoon of ghee and stir well. Turn off the flame and transfer the cooked chicken in a serving bowl. Garnish with fried onions and freshly chopped coriander leaves. Enjoy with butter naan or rumali roti.", "nutrients": {"servingSize": "1 bowl", "calories": "726 cal"}, "links": ["https://recipes.timesofindia.com/beverage/cocktails/bloodhound/rs56036742.cms",
