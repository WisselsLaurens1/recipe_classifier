Taste, and if you\u2019d like a more pronounced vanilla flavor, add another \u215b teaspoon vanilla extract. Be sure to measure out the extra vanilla extract rather than just pouring more in\u2014it\u2019s easy to go overboard.\nWhisk in the chia seeds. Let the mixture rest for about 15 minutes, then whisk the mixture again to break up any clumps. Cover the bowl and refrigerate for at least 2 hours (or overnight), until the chia seeds have absorbed enough moisture to achieve a pudding-like state. If you think of it, give it a stir sometime along the way to break up any clumps of chia.\nBefore serving, stir once again to break up any clumps of chia seeds. Serve with a drizzle of honey or maple syrup on top and any additional toppings you might like. This pudding will keep well in the refrigerator, covered, for about 5 days.", "nutrients": {"servingSize": "1", "calories": "275", "sugarContent": "0.1 g", "sodiumContent": "19.7 mg", "fatContent":
