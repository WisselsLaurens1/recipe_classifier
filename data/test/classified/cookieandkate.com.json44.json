Line a large, rimmed baking sheet with parchment paper for easy clean-up, if desired. If your baking sheet is smaller than mine, you may need to make the toast in two batches.\nSlice your baguette on the diagonal into pieces no wider than \u00bd-inch. I can usually fit 20 to 24 slices on my large baking sheet; you might have some bread left over. Lightly brush both sides of each slice with olive oil (this will require about 2 to 3 tablespoons oil).\nPlace the slices in a single layer on your prepared baking sheet and bake them on the middle rack for 6 to 9 minutes, until they\u2019re crisp and nicely golden on top. Sprinkle the toasts lightly with salt. Transfer the toasts to a serving platter, if desired, and use as desired.", "nutrients": {"servingSize": "1 of 24 crostini made with 2 tablespoons olive oil total", "calories": "63", "sugarContent":
