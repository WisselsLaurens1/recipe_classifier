Stir in the onion, bell pepper, sweet potato and salt. Saut\u00e9 for five minutes, stirring occasionally, until the onion starts to soften.\nAdd the curry paste and stir until the vegetables are coated and the curry is fragrant, about 1 minute.\nAdd the farro, if that\u2019s your grain of choice. Add the vegetable broth and water, and stir to combine.\nBring the mixture to a boil, then reduce the heat to a simmer and cook for 25 minutes.\nTest the farro for doneness\u2014if it\u2019s tender and cooked through, add the chickpeas and kale. Stir to combine, and cook for 5 more minutes, or until the kale is cooked to your liking. If you chose to use pre-cooked whole grains, add them now. (If the farro is not done cooking yet, continue simmering until it\u2019s tender, then proceed with the kale. This could take another 20 minutes, depending on the farro.)\nTaste, and season with more salt as needed. I usually add about \u00bd teaspoon\u2014if the soup tastes flat, add more salt. To kick up the flavor a notch and balance the sweetness of the sweet potatoes, stir in the optional cayenne pepper.\nLadle the soup into bowls and serve. I like this soup even more the next day. Leftovers keep well, covered and refrigerated, for about 4 days. The soup freezes well, too.", "nutrients": {}, "links": ["https://cookieandkate.com#comment-692927", "https://cookieandkate.com/tag/avocado/",
