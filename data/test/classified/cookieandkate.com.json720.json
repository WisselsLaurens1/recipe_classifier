On a large, rimmed baking sheet, toss broccoli florets with 2 tablespoons olive oil and a sprinkling of salt and pepper. Roast for 15 to 20 minutes on the middle rack, tossing halfway, until the edges are turning golden and crispy.\nTo toast the bread: Brush both sides of your sliced bread lightly with olive oil and place them on a separate baking sheet. Bake for 6 to 10 minutes on the top rack (larger slices will require more baking time), turning halfway, until lightly golden and toasted. Remove from oven and set aside.\nTo make the hummus: First, you\u2019ll whip the tahini and lemon juice together to make them ultra smooth and creamy. Combine the tahini and lemon juice in the bowl of your food processor (a smaller food processor will be better suited to the job) or high-powered blender (i.e. Vitamix or Blendtec). Process for about 1 \u00bd minutes, pausing to scrape down the bowl of your processor as necessary.\nAdd the olive oil, sun-dried tomatoes, chopped garlic, salt and red pepper flakes to the whipped tahini and lemon juice mixture. Process for about 1 minute, pausing to scrape down the bowl as necessary.\nAdd half of the chickpeas to the food processor and process for 1 minute. Scrape down the bowl, then add the remaining chickpeas and process for until the hummus is thick and quite smooth, about 1 to 2 minutes more. If your hummus is too thick or hasn\u2019t yet blended into creamy oblivion, run the food processor while drizzling in 2 to 3 tablespoons water, until it reaches your desired consistency.\nTo assemble your crostini: Top each piece of toast with a generous spread of hummus. Roughly chop the broccoli into small pieces, then top each toast with broccoli. Finish them off with a small sprinkle of lemon juice and red pepper flakes. Serve immediately.\nStore hummus in an airtight container and refrigerate for up to one week. Crostini is best when assembled just before serving.", "nutrients": {"servingSize": "2 crostini", "calories": "501", "sugarContent": "8.9 g", "sodiumContent": "683.6 mg", "fatContent": "23.9 g",
