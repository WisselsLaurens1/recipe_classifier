Let the mixture rest for 10 minutes, to give the garlic time to infuse the lemon juice with flavor.\nPour the mixture through a fine-mesh sieve into another medium bowl. Press the garlic solids with a spatula to extract as much liquid as possible. Discard the garlic.\nAdd the tahini, salt and cumin to the bowl. Whisk until the mixture is thoroughly blended.\nAdd water 2 tablespoons at a time, whisking after each addition until smooth. (It may seize up, don\u2019t worry.) After about 6 tablespoons, you will have a perfectly creamy and smooth, light-colored tahini sauce.\nIf desired, thin with additional water for a more drizzly sauce. Adjust if necessary\u2014if you\u2019d like more tang, add more lemon, or for more overall flavor, add another pinch of salt. Your tahini sauce is ready to serve!", "nutrients": {"servingSize": "About 3 tablespoons", "calories": "125", "sugarContent": "0.4 g", "sodiumContent": "210.2 mg", "fatContent": "10.8 g",
