Pull out a small skillet, preferably cast iron. Cooking 2 eggs? Use a medium-to-large skillet and use 2 tablespoons of olive oil.\nCrack an egg into a small bowl or ramekin and place it near the stove. Warm your skillet over medium-high heat until it\u2019s hot enough that a drop of water sizzles rapidly on contact.\nReduce the heat to medium and add the olive oil to the pan. Gently tilt the pan around so the olive oil covers the base of the pan. The olive oil should be so warm that it shimmers on the pan (if not, give it a little more time to warm up).\nCarefully pour the egg into the skillet and watch out for hot oil splatters (if you\u2019re planning to add another egg to the same pan, pour it onto the side so there\u2019s room for another).\nLet the egg cook, gently tilting the pan occasionally to redistribute the oil, until the edges are crisp and golden and the yolk is cooked to your liking, about 2 minutes for runny yolks or 2 \u00bd to 3 minutes for medium yolks. (If you\u2019re adding another egg to the skillet, go ahead and do it while the other is cooking.)\nTransfer the cooked egg(s) to a plate. If you\u2019d like to cook more eggs in the same skillet, add another drizzle of olive oil, leave the heat at medium (you might even need to dial it down a bit to avoid smoking) and add your next egg.
