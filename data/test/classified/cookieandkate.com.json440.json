Line two baking sheets with parchment paper (if you don\u2019t have parchment paper, lightly grease the baking sheets).\nMeasure out the honey and peanut butter\u2014I found this easiest to do in a small liquid measuring cup. Add honey to the \u00bd cup line, then add peanut butter until you reach the 1 cup total liquid line.\nPour the honey and peanut butter mixture into a mixing bowl. Add the mashed banana and melted butter and whisk until the mixture is well blended. Use your whisk to beat in the egg, scraping down the side of the bowl once it\u2019s incorporated. Whisk in the vanilla, baking soda, baking powder, salt and cinnamon.\nSwitch to a big spoon and stir in the ground oats, rolled oats, chocolate chips and sprinkles until they are evenly combined. Drop the dough by the heaping tablespoon (a small cookie scoop is perfect for this) onto your prepared baking sheets. I added a few extra sprinkles on top for good measure.\nBake the cookies, reversing the pans midway through (swap the cookies on the top rack with the cookies on the lower rack) until they\u2019re barely set and just beginning to turn golden around the edges, about 16 minutes. Remove the cookies from the oven and let them cool completely on the pans. If desired, sprinkle lightly with flaky sea salt now.", "nutrients": {}, "links": ["https://cookieandkate.com/tag/avocado/", "https://cookieandkate.com/category/vegetarian-mexican-recipes/",
