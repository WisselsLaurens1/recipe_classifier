Bring the mixture to a simmer and cook, stirring occasionally and reducing heat as necessary to avoid scorching as the jam condenses.\nSimmer until the mixture is completely broken down, reduced and thickened enough that you can scoop it on top of itself and it stays there, which will take somewhere between 30 to 50 minutes. Use the jam immediately or let it cool and store it, covered, for up to 1 month in the refrigerator.\nTo make the sandwiches: If you\u2019re making panini, brush olive oil or melted butter on one side of each slice of bread. Place the oiled sides down on a plate. Mix the mozzarella and Parmesan cheese together. Working in pairs, spread a generous layer of jam on one piece of bread and top the other with a generous handful of cheese, spread evenly down the bread (use a little more than you think you probably should). Top the cheese with a sprinkle of torn basil and press the other slice of bread, tomato jam-side down against the cheese to make a sandwich. Repeat for remaining sandwiches.\nGrill the sandwich in a panini press, electric grill or in a pan on the stovetop until both sides are crispy and turning golden brown on the edges. (I used an electric grill set to 400 degrees Fahrenheit, but here\u2019s a stovetop method that has worked for me\u2026 feel free to just make a grilled cheese here.) Repeat for remaining sandwiches.\nSlice the sandwich in half and serve!", "nutrients": {"servingSize": "1 sandwich", "calories": "1110", "sugarContent": "28.7 g", "sodiumContent": "2513.4 mg",
