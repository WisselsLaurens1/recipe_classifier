Prepare the broccoli rabe by rinsing it and patting it dry. Slice off the tough lower ends and any stems that are greater than \u00bc-inch in diameter. Toss the rabe with a light drizzle of olive oil and a sprinkle of salt and pepper. Rub the olive oil onto the leaves to make sure the rabe is lightly and evenly coated with oil. Set aside.\nIn a food processor or blender, combine the basil, almonds, Parmesan, garlic, lemon juice, salt and a few twists of freshly ground black pepper. Process the pesto while slowly drizzling in the olive oil, until the mixture is relatively smooth and uniform.\nPlace the naan on an oven-safe metal cooling rack, if you have one, then place the rack on a baking sheet to catch any drips (the rack helps the naan get nice and crisp). If not, just place the naan directly onto a baking sheet. Spread pesto on the naan and top with crumbled feta cheese. Top with an even layer of broccoli rabe and a light sprinkle of sliced almonds.\nBake until the broccoli rabe is tender and the leaves are deep green and crispy, about 8 to 9 minutes. Squeeze a small wedge of lemon over the naan and top with a light sprinkling of red pepper flakes. Let the naan cool slightly before slicing it with a sharp knife or pizza cutter and serving.", "nutrients": {"servingSize": "1 flatbread", "calories": "864", "sugarContent": "8.7 g", "sodiumContent":
