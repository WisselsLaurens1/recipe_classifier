Chop these bhindis and transfer them to a separate bowl. Sprinkle chaat masala and salt over them, keep aside. Place a pan over medium flame and pour oil in it. Once the oil is hot enough, add the bhindi in it and saute till they appear cooked. Once done, transfer them to a separate bowl and set aside.\nNow, in a separate bowl beat curd till its smooth. Next, add ginger, garlic cloves and green chillies in a grinder jar and grind it on high speed for a few seconds till you achieve a coarse paste. In the same pan used in the first step, add a little oil and when its hot enough, add cumin seeds along with asafoetida and saute well. After a few seconds, add chopped onion slices to it and saute till they turn translucent.\nAdd the ginger-garlic paste to the pan and saute till the aroma of raw ginger and garlic disappears. Now, add chopped tomatoes to it and cook till they appear soft. After a few minutes add gram flour, turmeric powder and coriander powder to the pan and saute for a minute or two over medium flame. Add the curd to the pan now and stir quickly. After some time add water to it and sprinkle some salt over it.\nCover the pan using a lid and simmer for a minimum of 5 minutes. Remove the lid after 5 minutes and add the sauteed bhindi to the pan followed by fresh cream and stir well. Sprinkle garam masala and fenugreek leaves over the dish and cover the pan again using a lid. Let it simmer for another 10 minutes over low flame. Your Shahi Bhindi is now ready. Garnish with coriander leaves and serve hot with chapatis or rice.", "nutrients": {"servingSize": "1 bowl", "calories": "190 cal"}, "links":
