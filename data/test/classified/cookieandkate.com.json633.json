Drain them, then rinse the cashews under running water.\nPlace the drained cashews in your blender and add 1 cup of the water. Blend the mixture on high until the cashews are totally pulverized and the mixture is very creamy. Add the remaining 1 cup of water, the maple syrup and vanilla extract, and blend again. Taste, and blend in additional maple syrup if you\u2019d like it to be sweeter. (If your cashew milk still has tiny bits of cashews in it, pour it through a fine metal sieve into a glass.)\nTo make a cocktail: Fill a short cocktail glass with ice. Pour in the vodka, followed by the Kahlua and cashew cream. Lightly swirl the contents with a spoon, and enjoy.", "nutrients": {}, "links": ["https://cookieandkate.com/tag/avocado/", "https://cookieandkate.com/vegan-white-russian-recipe/#comments",
