I like to make extra to freeze for later. Toss the warm cooked grains with a drizzle of olive oil, the juice of \u00bd lemon and a sprinkle of sea salt. Set aside.\nMake the dressing: In a liquid measuring cup, whisk together the dressing ingredients until emulsified. Transfer to an air-tight container with a lid to store the leftovers.\nToast the seeds: In a small pan over medium heat, toast the sunflower seeds/pepitas until they are fragrant and turning golden at the edges, stirring often, about 4 minutes.\nAssemble the salad: Place a generous portion of greens in two bowls. Divide the remaining salad ingredients, grains included, between the two bowls. Just before you are ready to serve, toss the salad with Greek dressing.", "nutrients": {}, "links": ["https://cookieandkate.com/tag/avocado/",
