Place the baguette slices on a baking sheet. Bake until slightly golden, about 6 to 8 minutes, then remove from the oven. While the toast is baking, heat the butter in a small saucepan over medium heat. Whisk constantly as it bubbles until brown bits appear on the bottom, anywhere from 5 to 8 minutes. The minute the brown bits appear, turn off the heat and remove the skillet. Continue to whisk for 30 seconds then stir in the garlic.\nHeat a large skillet over medium heat and add the bacon. Cook until crispy and fat is rendered, then add in the shallot, garlic, zucchini, salt, pepper and paprika. Stir to coat the ingredients in the bacon fat and cook until the vegetables soften and become slightly golden, about 5 to 6 minutes. Stir occasionally. Add in half of the goat cheese and stir. Turn off heat.\nWhile the zucchini is cooking, cook your eggs as desired. I poached mine using this method from smitten kitchen. It never fails me. Drizzle the garlic brown butter over the baguette slices and serve the zucchini and egg with extra goat cheese and a sprinkle of salt and pepper.", "nutrients": {}, "links": ["https://www.howsweeteats.com/summer-fridays/", "https://www.amazon.com/shop/howsweeteats", "http://viralcamera.com/blog/?p=50710", "https://www.howsweeteats.com/2013/07/zucchini-summer-skillet-with-poached-eggs-garlic-brown-butter-baguettes/#comments", "https://www.howsweeteats.com/wprm_print/recipe/59515", "https://www.howsweeteats.com/recipes/video/", "https://www.howsweeteats.com/about/", "https://www.howsweeteats.com#comment-1140819", "https://www.howsweeteats.com/cookbook/", "https://www.indiebound.org/book/9780593137499?aff=penguinrandom", "http://savetherusticos.com/2015/01/35-delicious-ways-to-use-zucchini/", "https://www.howsweeteats.com#comment-1145363", "https://www.howsweeteats.com/crumbs/reading-lists/", "https://www.howsweeteats.com/crumbs/jessicas-book-club/", "https://www.howsweeteats.com/recipes/breakfast/", "https://www.howsweeteats.com#content", "http://www.pinterest.com/howsweeteats", "http://www.bvlgarieshop.asia/", "https://www.instagram.com/howsweeteats/", "https://www.howsweeteats.com/recipes/appetizers/", "https://www.howsweeteats.com#comments", "http://temp.fivejsdesign.com/index.php/2013/07/13/weekend-wishlist/", "https://www.purrdesign.com", "https://www.howsweeteats.com/recipes/dinner/", "https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/0593137493?ie=UTF8&tag=hoswitis07-20&camp=1789&linkCode=xm2&creativeASIN=0593137493", "http://www.howsweeteats.com/", "http://billiondollarmindset.us/blog/2017/02/03/35-delicious-ways-to-use-zucchini/", "https://www.facebook.com/howsweeteats/", "https://www.howsweeteats.com/crushing-on/", "https://www.facebook.com/howsweeteats", "https://www.howsweeteats.com#comment-1174104", "https://www.howsweeteats.com/what-to-eat-this-week/", "http://www.howsweeteats.com/2011/08/grilled-corn-summer-breakfast-hash-2/", "https://www.howsweeteats.com/recipes/lunch-ideas/", "https://www.howsweeteats.com/faq/", "http://www.clean9cleanse.net/", "https://www.howsweeteats.com/contact/", "http://lexiscleankitchen.com/2014/07/11/healthy-food-friday-zucchini-roasted-garlic-chicken-and-veggie-primavera/", "https://www.howsweeteats.com/2013/07/zucchini-summer-skillet-with-poached-eggs-garlic-brown-butter-baguettes/#respond", "https://www.howsweeteats.com/recipes/drinks/", "https://www.twitter.com/howsweeteats", "https://www.instagram.com/howsweeteats", "http://sinisterapps.co/35-delicious-ways-to-use-zucchini/", "https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/0544176499?ie=UTF8&tag=hoswitis07-20&camp=1789&linkCode=xm2&creativeASIN=0544176499", "https://www.howsweeteats.com#wprm-recipe-container-59515", "https://www.howsweeteats.com/", "http://www.howsweeteats.com/2013/07/chocolate-peanut-butter-truffle-pie/", "http://smittenkitchen.com/blog/2008/08/how-to-poach-an-egg-smitten-kitchen-style/", "https://www.barnesandnoble.com/w/everyday-dinners-jessica-merchant/1137397413?ean=9780593137499", "http://twinstripe.com/blog/farmstand-zucchini/", "https://www.howsweeteats.com/privacy/", "https://www.howsweeteats.com/2013/07/chocolate-peanut-butter-truffle-pie/", "https://books.apple.com/us/book/id1525129387", "https://www.howsweeteats.com#comment-817000", "http://clean9cleanse.net", "https://www.howsweeteats.com/recipes/", "https://www.howsweeteats.com/2013/07/frosty-coconut-mojitos/", "https://www.howsweeteats.com/recipe-index/", "https://www.howsweeteats.com/recipes/desserts/", "https://www.howsweeteats.com/crumbs/tuesday-things/", "http://foodandnonsense.com/120/", "https://www.howsweeteats.com/2013/07/zucchini-summer-skillet-with-poached-eggs-garlic-brown-butter-baguettes/comment-page-1/#comments", "http://singviral.com/35-delicious-ways-to-use-zucchini/", "https://bookshop.org/a/4747/9780593137499", "http://kojo-designs.com/2013/09/75-must-try-zucchini-recipes/", "https://www.howsweeteats.com/crumbs/favorites/", "https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/162336969X?ie=UTF8&tag=hoswitis07-20&camp=1789&linkCode=xm2&creativeASIN=162336969X", "http://mort.securedserverspace.com/~acalcula/2013/07/weekend-wishlis.html", "https://rstyle.me/+WNKH3v3eQ7-OVhgytg8KzQ", "https://www.howsweeteats.com/crumbs/"], "author": ["Jessica"], "cuisine": "American", "reviews": {}}}
