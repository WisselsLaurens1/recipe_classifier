Line a large, rimmed baking sheet with parchment paper for easy cleanup.\nTo prepare your Brussels sprouts, slice off the nubby ends and remove any discolored or damaged leaves. Cut each sprout in half from the flat base through the top.\nOn your baking sheet, combine the halved sprouts and olive oil. Toss until the sprouts are lightly and evenly coated. Arrange the sprouts in an even layer with their flat sides facing down.\nRoast the sprouts until they are tender and deeply golden on the edges, about 18 to 24 minutes. Remove the sprouts from the oven and transfer them to a large serving platter or shallow serving bowl.\nIn the meantime, prepare the buffalo sauce by whisking together the hot sauce and melted butter in a small bowl. Season to taste with black pepper. If the mixture tastes too spicy, whisk in some honey to temper the heat a bit. Set aside.\nOnce the roasted Brussels sprouts are on the serving platter, drizzle the sauce all over them. If desired, sprinkle avocado or blue cheese over the sprouts. Finish the dish with a sprinkle of chives and fresh cilantro. Taste, and sprinkle lightly with salt if needed. Serve.\nThese Brussels sprouts are best consumed fresh, especially if avocado is involved. Leftovers without avocado will keep for several days in the refrigerator, covered.", "nutrients": {"servingSize": "1 of 4 servings as shown (with avocado, no honey)", "calories": "242",
