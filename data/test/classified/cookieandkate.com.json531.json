Place the sweet potatoes flat-side down on the baking sheet. Bake until they\u2019re tender and cooked through, about 30 to 35 minutes. Leave the oven on, since we\u2019ll bake the assembled enchiladas soon (no temperature adjustments necessary).\nMeanwhile, pour enough salsa verde into a 9 by 13-inch baking dish to lightly cover the bottom (about \u00bd cup). In a medium mixing bowl, combine all of the remaining filling ingredients.\nOnce the sweet potatoes are cooked through and cool enough to handle, scoop out the insides with a spoon. Discard the potato skins, and lightly mash the sweet potatoes with a fork or the back of a spoon.\nStir the mashed sweet potato into the bowl of filling, and season to taste with additional salt (I added \u00bc teaspoon) and pepper.\nWarm up your tortillas, one by one in a skillet, or all at once in a microwave so they don\u2019t break when you bend them. Wrap them in a clean tea towel so they stay warm.\nWorking with one tortilla at a time, spread about \u00bd cup filling down the center each tortilla, then wrap both sides over the filling and place it in your baking dish. Repeat for all of the tortillas.\nTop with the remaining salsa verde and cheese. Bake for 25 to 35 minutes, until sauce is bubbling and the cheese is lightly golden.\nLet the enchiladas cool for about 5 minutes. Whisk the sour cream and water together to make a drizzly sour cream sauce. Drizzle it back and forth over the enchiladas, then top them with cilantro and red onion.
