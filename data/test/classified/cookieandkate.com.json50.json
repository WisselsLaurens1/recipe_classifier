Grease a 9 by 13-inch pan with butter (don\u2019t be tempted to use cooking spray; it doesn\u2019t work nearly as well).\nIn a large skillet, warm the olive oil over medium heat until shimmering. Add the bell pepper and green onion and cook until the pepper is tender and cooked through, about 8 to 10 minutes.\nAdd the spinach to the skillet and cook, while stirring, until wilted, about 2 minutes. Set the pan aside to cool for a bit while we prepare the egg mixture.\nCrack the eggs into a medium mixing bowl. Add your dairy of choice, several dashes of hot sauce, plus the salt and pepper. Whisk just until the egg yolks and whites are blended.\nStir in half of the cheese (we\u2019re reserving the other half for topping the frittata before baking). Transfer the lightly cooled veggies into the bowl, and stir to combine.\nPour the mixture into the prepared pan. Evenly disperse the remaining cheese on top.\nBake for 25 to 35 minutes (keep an eye on it), until the eggs are puffed and appear cooked, and the center of the frittata just barely jiggles when you give it a gentle shimmy. For good measure, insert a fork about \u00bc-inch into the center of the eggs and make sure the fork comes out clean\nPlace the frittata on a cooling rack until you\u2019re ready to serve. Slice with a sharp knife, and serve. Leftovers will keep well for about four days in the refrigerator. Enjoy leftovers chilled, at room temperature, or gently reheat in the microwave or oven.", "nutrients": {"servingSize": "1 medium portion", "calories": "191", "sugarContent": "3.1 g", "sodiumContent":
