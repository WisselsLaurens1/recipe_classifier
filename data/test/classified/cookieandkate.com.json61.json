Chop the kale into small, bite-sized pieces. Sprinkle it lightly with salt, followed by a squeeze of lime juice (about 1 teaspoon). Massage the kale by scrunching it up in your hands, repeating until the kale is darker green and fragrant (this step softens the kale and makes it less bitter). You\u2019ll need 1 cup (packed) kale for the guacamole, so measure it out and set it aside.\nNext, use a spoon to scoop the flesh of the avocados into the bowl of a food processor, discarding any bruised, browned areas. Add 3 tablespoons lime juice and the salt. Blend until the mixture is fairly smooth, pausing to scrape down the sides as necessary.\nAdd the massaged kale, onion, cilantro and jalape\u00f1o. Blend until the mixture is mostly smooth, with only tiny bits of kale and onion remaining (or completely smooth, if you prefer). Taste, and add additional salt and/or lime juice, if necessary, and blend again (I usually add up to \u00bd teaspoon more salt and another tablespoon of lime juice).
