Line two large, rimmed baking sheets with parchment paper to prevent the vegetables from sticking.\nOn one pan, combine the cauliflower and sweet potato. On the other pan, combine the bell peppers and onion. Drizzle half of the olive oil over one pan, and the other half over the other pan. Same with the cumin.\nSprinkle both pans lightly with salt and pepper, then toss each one until the vegetables are lightly coated in oil and spices, adding another light drizzle of olive oil if necessary. Arrange the vegetables in an even layer across each pan. Bake until the vegetables are tender and caramelized on the edges, about 30 to 35 minutes, tossing the veggies and swapping the pans halfway.\nWhen you\u2019re ready to assemble, reduce the oven heat to 350 degrees Fahrenheit and lightly grease a 9\u2033 square baker. Stir the cilantro into the salsa.\nTo assemble, spread \u00bd cup salsa evenly over the bottom of the baking pan. Add a single layer of halved tortilla pieces, arranging them so they completely cover the salsa.\nTop with \u00bd of the beans, \u2153 of the vegetables, \u00bd of the of spinach, and \u2153 of the cheese.\nMake a second layer of tortillas (I pressed down on the mixture a little here to make room for the next layers). Top with \u00bd of the remaining salsa, all of the remaining beans, \u00bd of the remaining vegetables, all of the remaining spinach, and \u00bd of the remaining cheese.\nMake a third layer of tortillas (again, I pressed down to make more room). Top with the remaining salsa, vegetables, and cheese.\nCover the pan with parchment paper (I tent mine in the middle and wrap the edges around the handles) or aluminum foil. Bake for 20 minutes, then remove the parchment paper or aluminum foil and bake for 10 more minutes, or until heated through.\nLet the casserole cool for 10 minutes, to give it time to set and reach a palatable temperature. Before serving, sprinkle the top lightly with additional chopped cilantro.", "nutrients": {}, "links": ["https://cookieandkate.com/tag/avocado/",
