Fold a lint-free tea towel in half and place it next to the dish. Place your prepared spring roll fillings within reach.\nPlace one rice paper in the water and let it rest for about twenty seconds. You\u2019ll learn to go by feel here\u2014wait until the sheet is pliable but not super floppy. Carefully lay it flat on the towel.\nLeaving about an inch of open rice paper around the edge, cover the lower third of the paper with about \u00bd cup chopped arugula. Top with four slices of mango down the length of the greens, followed by several slices of bell pepper and jalape\u00f1o, and finally, a sprinkle of green onions.\nFold over one long side to enclose the filling, then fold over the short sides like you would a burrito, and lastly, roll it up, stretching the remaining long side around the the roll to seal it. Repeat with remaining ingredients.\nTo make your avocado sauce, combine the avocado, lime juice, water, cilantro and salt in a small food processor or blender. Pur\u00e9e until smooth and transfer to a small serving bowl. If you won\u2019t be serving the rolls immediately, press plastic wrap against the surface of the dip to prevent oxidation.\nSlice the rolls in half on the diagonal with a sharp chef\u2019s knife or serve whole, with avocado dipping sauce on the side.", "nutrients": {"servingSize": "1 roll", "calories": "254", "sugarContent": "17.5 g", "sodiumContent": "389.2 mg", "fatContent": "8.1 g",
