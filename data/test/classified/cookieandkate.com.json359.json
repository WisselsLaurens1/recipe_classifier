Transfer to a small bowl or divide into individual ramekins. (You can make the dipping sauce a day ahead, just cover and store in the refrigerator until ready to serve.)\nDrain the water from the tofu and very gently squish some of the water out of the tofu. Slice the tofu into two slabs by cutting lengthwise through the center. Wrap the slabs in a clean tea towel or paper towels. Stack the slabs on top of each other and place a heavy saucepan or a plate and cans on top to help press out more of the moisture.\nPrepare the arugula, herbs and vegetables as directed in the ingredients list above. Set them out on your work surface, with a clean tea towel on the side.\nRemove the towels from the tofu and slice each slab into about 7 equal-sized strips (less than \u00bd-inch in width). Sprinkle sesame seeds onto a plate or cutting board and gently roll the tofu strips to coat.\nFill a bowl or baking pan with warm water. Place one rice paper in the water and let it rest for about twenty seconds. You\u2019ll learn to go by feel here\u2014the sheet should be pliable enough to give to touch but not super floppy. Lay it on the towel.\nTop the rice paper in a lengthwise orientation (as shown) with a big sprinkle of arugula, one strip of tofu, a few strips of carrot, cucumber, bell pepper and jalape\u00f1o (if using). Sprinkle with some chopped green onion, cilantro and mint.\nFold over one long side to enclose the filling, then fold over the short sides like you would a burrito, and lastly, roll it up, stretching the remaining long side around the the roll to seal it. Serve the rolls whole or cut in half, with dipping sauce on the side.", "nutrients": {"servingSize": "Two summer rolls with peanut sauce", "calories": "418", "sugarContent": "13.1 g", "sodiumContent":
