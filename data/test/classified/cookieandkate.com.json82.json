Place the halved peaches in a blender or food processor, and blend until the pur\u00e9e is completely smooth. Peach pur\u00e9e is best served chilled, so place it in the refrigerator for at least 30 minutes to cool.\nWhen you\u2019re ready to serve, pour 2 ounces (\u00bc cup) chilled peach pur\u00e9e into a Champagne flute. Pour in some chilled Prosecco, being careful not to overflow the glass.
