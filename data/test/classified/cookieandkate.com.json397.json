Generously grease a 9\u2033 springform pan* and dust it with almond meal to prevent sticking.\nTo make the cake: In a large bowl, combine 2 cups of the almond meal, the baking powder, baking soda, salt, and cinnamon. Whisk to blend.\nCrack the eggs into a medium bowl and beat with a whisk until the yolks and egg whites have blended together. Add the maple syrup, olive oil, and lemon zest and whisk to blend. Pour the wet ingredients into the almond meal mixture and stir until there are just a few clumps remaining.\nScrape the batter into the prepared pan (it will be runny; don\u2019t worry). Bake for 40 to 45 minutes, or until the cake is golden brown and the center is firm to the touch.\nMeanwhile, to make the glaze: In a small bowl, whisk together the lemon juice and 1 tablespoon maple syrup until blended. (If you\u2019re using honey instead and having a hard time blending it into the lemon juice, place the bowl on top of your stove to warm it up while the cake bakes, or warm it briefly in the microwave until you can whisk them together.)\nOnce the cake is out of the oven, place the cake, pan and all, on a cooling rack. While the cake is warm, use a pastry brush to brush the glaze over the top of the cake. It should soak right in.\nLet the cake cool for at least 30 minutes. Carefully remove the outer piece from your springform pan.\nSpread yogurt evenly on top, then place strawberries and blueberries on top. Sprinkle with some additional lemon zest, then slice the cake with a sharp knife and serve! Store any remaining cake in the refrigerator, covered, for up to 4 days.", "nutrients": {"servingSize": "1 slice", "calories": "383", "sugarContent": "22.8 g", "sodiumContent": "268.5 mg",
