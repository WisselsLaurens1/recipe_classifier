Poke the eggplant all over with a fork; place onto baking sheet.\nBake these in the pre-heated oven until the garlic has turned golden brown and the eggplant is tender for about 30 to 40 minutes. Allow it to cool until its good enough to handle with bare hands.\nPeel eggplant and chop into large chunks; peel or squeeze the roasted garlic from its skin and set aside.\nWhile these two are baking, prepare red lentils aside. Soak them for half an hour, wash and drain well.\nPour in 2 cups of water in a pan, add in the lentils with a pinch of salt and bring to a boil.\nTurn the flame to lowest and simmer the lentils for nearly half an hour, covered, till they are all tender and mushy.\nHeat a tablespoon of olive oil in a large saucepan over medium heat.\nStir in onion, and cook until soft and translucent, about 5 minutes.\nPour in veg stock, and then stir in reserved eggplant, roasted garlic, tomato puree, cooked lentils and spices.\nBring to a boil over medium-high heat, then reduce heat to medium-low, cover, and simmer for 25-30 minutes.\nOnce cooked, carefully puree soup in batches in a blender or food processor until smooth. Return soup to the stove in a clean saucepan.\nStir in the milk, season to taste with salt, cumin powder, crushed bay leaves and pepper; cook over medium-low heat until hot.\nServe with a dash of cream on top with bread of choice aside.", "nutrients": {"servingSize": "1 bowl", "calories": "327 cal"}, "links": ["https://recipes.timesofindia.com/beverage/cocktails/bloodhound/rs56036742.cms",
