Toss to combine, and place in the refrigerator to lightly pickle while you prepare the rest of the salad.\nMake the yogurt sauce: In a food processor, combine the yogurt, fresh herbs, olive oil, honey, and a pinch of salt. Blend until the herbs are broken into tiny pieces and the sauce is pale green. (If you don\u2019t have a food processor, finely chop the herbs and whisk the ingredients together in a bowl.)\nSwirl the yogurt sauce (all of it) over the base of a large serving platter. Scatter the cubed watermelon on top, followed by the cucumber. Arrange the pickled shallot on top, and spoon the leftover vinegar over the salad.\nDrizzle 2 tablespoons olive oil on top, sprinkle generously with fresh herbs, and season with salt and pepper, to taste. If you won\u2019t be serving immediately, place the salad in the refrigerator to stay chilled. This salad is best served within an hour or two.", "nutrients": {"servingSize": "1 of 6 side servings made with low-fat yogurt", "calories": "179", "sugarContent": "18.3 g", "sodiumContent": "205 mg",
