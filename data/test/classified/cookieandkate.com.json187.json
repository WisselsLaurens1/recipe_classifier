Taste and adjust the seasoning if necessary (more lime juice, salt and pepper, etc.). Cover the salsa and let it rest for at least 30 minutes in order for the flavors to meld and the beans to soak up the surrounding flavors.\nTo make the tostadas: Preheat the oven to 450 degrees Fahrenheit. Spray each tortilla with cooking spray on both sides (I used organic olive oil spray) or brush them lightly with olive oil. Place them on a baking sheet in a single layer. Bake for 8 to 12 minutes, until golden and crispy.\nIn a skillet over medium heat, pour in the olive oil. Add black beans and their cooking liquid, and mix in some hot sauce and red pepper flakes. Mash the mixture with a potato masher for five minutes or longer, until the beans have reduced to your desired consistency. (This is the lazy way to do it, if you\u2019d like to go all out, make the beans as directed in my chipotle-glazed squash recipe).\nSpread bean mixture evenly over each tortilla and top with tomatillo salsa. Finish with your selected toppings. Pick it up with your hands or be fancy and eat it with a fork and steak knife.", "nutrients": {"servingSize": "1 tostada, no additional toppings", "calories": "211", "sugarContent": "3.4 g",
