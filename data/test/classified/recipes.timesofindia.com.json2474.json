Using little water at a time, bind the ingredients together to form a soft dough. Keep it covered with a wet cloth and let it rest till further use.\nTo prepare the stuffing, take a bowl and add white cabbage, green peppercorns, coriander leaves, ginger, salt, paneer, onions, garlic and green chillis. Mix these ingredients well and keep them aside.\nNow to shape the momos, divide the dough into 20 balls of equal size. Take one part, give it a round shape using your hands and roll it using a rolling pin as thin as possible. (Just like the way you make rotis). Fill some stuffing in the center of the circle, lift both the sides and seal them together by applying little water on the edges. Keep aside the momos and cover them with a wet cloth. Follow the same procedure for all the remaining portions.\nOnce done, steam these momos in the momo stand or idli stand for 15-20 minutes in a medium flame. To make the chutney, take some water in a pressure cooker. Add the tomatoes, garlic and chillies and pressure cook these ingredients for 1 whistle. Turn off the flame after 1 whistle and let the pressure release on its own.\nOnce the pressure releases, take out the tomatoes, garlic and chillies and allow them to cool. After they are cooled, blend it in a mixer to a smooth paste without adding any water. Transfer the chutney in a serving bowl. Add salt, mustard oil and coriander leaves. Mix well and serve the hot momos with the red chilli chutney.", "nutrients": {"servingSize": "1 bowl", "calories": "542 cal"}, "links":
