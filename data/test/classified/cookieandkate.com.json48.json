In your blender, combine the cashews with 2 cups of the water. Add all of the remaining ingredients (turmeric, cinnamon, ginger, cardamom, pepper, salt, honey and vanilla).\nStart on a low setting and increase the speed until the cashews are blended into creamy oblivion. This could take 2 minutes in a high-powered blender or longer in a regular blender.\nBlend in 2 cups more water until creamy. Taste, and if the mixture tastes too fiery, you can blend in a bit more sweetener (though the flavors seem to mellow a bit with time).\nTo serve cold, fill a drinking glass with ice and pour the golden milk on top. Or to serve warm, gently heat your desired quantity in a saucepan on the stove over medium-low heat until steaming, stirring often (don\u2019t overdo it, or the texture won\u2019t be as nice). Store leftover golden milk in the refrigerator for up to 4 days.", "nutrients": {"servingSize": "1 cup", "calories": "198", "sugarContent": "8.6 g", "sodiumContent": "69 mg", "fatContent": "12.8 g",
