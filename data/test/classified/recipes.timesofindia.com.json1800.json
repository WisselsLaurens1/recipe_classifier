This will deeply infuse the the flavours of rum and cinnamon in the nuts, giving them a refreshing texture.\nNext, take a medium-sized bowl and sugar into it. Then, add 150 grams of butter out of the total mentioned quantity. Take care of the quantities and beat the mixture softly. After beating up the mixture for a while, add eggs into it. Now beat the mixture well until smooth.\nNow, take water in a cup and heat it in the oven for about 30 seconds until lukewarm. Then, add the mentioned quantity of yeast into it.\nTo start with the preparation of dough, first, take a large-sized bowl and add the yeast water mixture into it. Next, add flour and salt. Also, add the rum-soaked nuts and sugar-butter mix into it. After adding all the mentioned ingredients, mix well and keep the dough aside for at least 15 minutes.\nAfter the dough has fermented well, take out small portions from it. Add marzipan in each portion and seal it. Now, roll and merge the small portions all together and create a bread loaf out of it. Keep this bread loaf dough aside for next 30 minutes so that the flavour of marzipan is infused in the dough properly.\nNow, preheat the OTG at 175\u00b0 and then place the bread loaf into it. Bake it for 25 minutes.\nOnce you are done with the baking, let the bread cool down. Then, brush it with the remaining butter and sprinkle powdered sugar upon it. Next, slice the bread equally and serve.", "nutrients": {"servingSize": "1 bowl", "calories": "724 cal"}, "links": ["https://recipes.timesofindia.com/beverage/cocktails/bloodhound/rs56036742.cms",
