Cook the soba noodles until al dente, according to package directions. Drain and rinse the noodles with cool water until they are room temperature, shaking out all the excess water. Transfer the noodles to a large serving bowl and set aside.\nWhile the noodles are cooking, in a medium mixing bowl, combine the radishes, cucumber, vinegar and 1 teaspoon of the salt. Let the veggies marinate for 10 minutes, tossing occasionally.\n(Phoebe did this step in a food processor but I opted to whisk together by hand.) In a 2-cup liquid measuring cup, combine the almond butter, garlic, lime juice, tamari, honey, sesame oil and remaining 1 teaspoon salt. Whisk until blended, then add \u00bc cup water and blend again. If necessary, add more water, 1 tablespoon at a time, until you reach the consistency of peanut sauce.\nPour the sauce into the mixing bowl with the soba noodles. Add the zucchini noodles and toss until everything is well coated. Divide among serving bowls, top with quick-pickled veggies, and garnish with a sprinkle of sesame seeds.\nServe room temperature or cold, with your favorite Asian hot sauce on the side.", "nutrients":
