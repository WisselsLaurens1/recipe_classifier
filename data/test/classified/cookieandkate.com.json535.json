Line two large, rimmed baking sheets with parchment paper so the fries don\u2019t get stuck to the pans.\nPeel the sweet potatoes and cut them into fry-shaped pieces about \u00bc\u2033 wide and \u00bc\u2033 thick. Try to cut them into similarly sized pieces so the fries will bake evenly. Transfer half of the uncooked fries to one baking sheet, and the other half to the other baking sheet.\nSprinkle the sweet potato fries with the cornstarch (use 1 \u00bd teaspoons per pan) and salt (\u00bc teaspoon per pan). Toss until the fries are lightly coated in powder. Drizzle the olive oil over the fries (1 tablespoon per pan) and toss until the fries are lightly and evenly coated in oil, and no powdery spots remain (use your fingers to rub visible cornstarch into the fries as necessary).\nArrange your fries in a single layer and don\u2019t overcrowd; otherwise they will never crisp up. Bake for 20 minutes, then flip the fries so they can cook on all sides. (The easiest way to flip them is with a metal spatula. Section by section, scoop up about ten fries and flip them with a quick turn of the wrist.)\nArrange the fries in even layers across the pans again, moving any particularly browned fries more toward the middle of the pan so they don\u2019t get overcooked. Return the pans to the oven, swapping their positions (former top pan goes to the lower rack and vice versa).\nBake for 10 to 18 more minutes, or until the fries are crispy. You\u2019ll know they\u2019re almost done when the surface of the fries change from shiny orange to a more matte, puffed up texture. Keep an eye on them, as they can turn from crisp to burnt quickly. Sometimes the lower pan will be done a few minutes before the top pan. Don\u2019t worry if the edges are a little bit brown; they will taste more caramelized than burnt.\nIf desired, toss the baked fries with seasonings, to taste. I like to use lots of freshly ground black pepper, and a scant \u00bc teaspoon each cayenne pepper and garlic powder.
