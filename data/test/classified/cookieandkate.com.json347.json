In a medium saucepan, heat the oil over medium heat. Add the onions and garlic and saut\u00e9 until the onion starts to caramelize, which will take about 10 minutes. Add the pepper flakes and red pepper and cook until the pepper softens, about 2 minutes.\nAdd the tomatoes and heat until the sauce begins to simmer. Lower heat and cook (uncovered) until thickened, about 15 minutes. Stir frequently.\nSlice the ends off two to three zucchinis. Use a vegetable peeler to shave off strips of zucchini. It\u2019s easier than you think it\u2019ll be.\nOn a baking sheet, layer the zucchini a few layers deep, and drizzle with olive oil. Sprinkle some freshly ground black pepper on top.\nBake for about 10 minutes, until the zucchini has lost its crunch.\nBack to the sauce: stir in the basil and chickpeas. Add salt and pepper, to taste. Cook about 5 more minutes, until everything is heated through. Serve generous portions of zucchini pasta topped with arrabiata sauce!", "nutrients": {"servingSize": "", "calories": "401", "sugarContent": "22 g", "sodiumContent": "308.7 mg", "fatContent": "16.5
