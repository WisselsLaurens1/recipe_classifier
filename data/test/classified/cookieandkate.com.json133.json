If necessary, grease all 12 cups on your muffin tin with butter or cooking spray (my pan is non-stick and doesn\u2019t require any grease).\nIn a large mixing bowl, combine the flour, \u2153 cup oats, baking powder, baking soda and salt. Stir with a whisk to blend.\nIn a medium mixing bowl, combine the oil, maple syrup and eggs. Beat together with a whisk. Add the yogurt and vanilla, and mix well.\nPour the wet ingredients into the dry and mix with a big spoon, just until combined (a few lumps are ok). Gently fold the strawberries into the batter. The mixture will be thick, but don\u2019t worry.\nDivide the batter evenly between the 12 muffin cups (I used an ice cream scoop with a wire level, which worked perfectly). They will be quite full!\nSprinkle the tops of the muffins with the remaining 2 tablespoons of oats, followed by the turbinado sugar. Bake the muffins for 19 to 22 minutes, or until the muffins are golden on top and a toothpick inserted into a muffin comes out clean.\nPlace the muffin tin on a cooling rack to cool. You might need to run a butter knife along the outer edge of the muffins to loosen them from the pan.", "nutrients": {"servingSize": "1 muffin", "calories": "210", "sugarContent": "15 g",
