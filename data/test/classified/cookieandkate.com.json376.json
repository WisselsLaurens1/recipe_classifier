Take the garlic clove and rub it on both sides of each slice of bread, for extra flavor. Brush both sides of each slice with olive oil, then arrange the slices in a single layer on a large, rimmed baking sheet.\nBake the sliced bread until just slightly golden brown, about 5 to 8 minutes. Set aside.\nIn the meantime, in a medium serving bowl, combine all of the bruschetta ingredients. Toss to coat, then adjust seasonings as needed, adding more salt, oregano, or vinegar, as desired.\nServe the toasted bread with the tomato topping on the side. This appetizer is best when fresh, but you can store the tomato topping for up to 2 days, covered, in the refrigerator.", "nutrients": {}, "links": ["https://cookieandkate.com/tag/avocado/",
