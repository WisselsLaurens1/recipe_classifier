Toss the ingredients together and set aside.\nTo prepare the dressing, combine all of the ingredients in a liquid measuring cup. Whisk until blended. Taste, and add more salt if the dressing doesn\u2019t knock your socks off (I usually add one to two more pinches of salt).\nIf you\u2019ll be serving all of the salad at once, go ahead and drizzle enough dressing in to lightly coat the salad and toss to combine. I prefer to store the salad and dressing separately so I can enjoy salad for a few days. Just whisk the dressing again before drizzling (if the olive oil solidifies a bit in the refrigerator, don\u2019t worry, that\u2019s normal\u2014just let it warm up for about 5 minutes at room temperature or microwave for 10 to 20 seconds).", "nutrients": {}, "links": ["https://cookieandkate.com/tag/avocado/", "https://cookieandkate.com/category/vegetarian-mexican-recipes/",
