If using 1 large orange, slice it in half through the round middle, then slice one of the halves into rounds. Place the rounds into a medium heavy-bottomed pot or small Dutch oven. Squeeze the juice from the remaining oranges into the pot.\nPour the wine into the pot, followed by the brandy. Add 1 tablespoon of the sweetener for now. Add the cinnamon sticks, star anise and cloves.\nWarm the mixture over medium heat until steaming (about 5 minutes), and keep an eye on it. When you start seeing the tiniest of bubbles at the surface, reduce the heat to the lowest of low.\nCarefully taste, and add another tablespoon of sweetener if it\u2019s not sweet enough for your liking. If it\u2019s not spicy enough to suit your preferences, continue cooking over very low heat for 5 to 10 more minutes.\nServe in mugs with your desired garnishes! If you\u2019re adding cranberries as I did, you can add them to the pot to make it look extra festive.\nIf you expect to polish off the mulled wine within 20 minutes or so, you can keep it on the stove over extra-low heat (it will become more spicy with time). Otherwise, remove it from the heat, cover, and rewarm over low heat if necessary. Leftovers will keep in the refrigerator for a couple of days, covered (pour it through a strainer if you don\u2019t want it to become any more spicy than it already is).", "nutrients": {"servingSize":
