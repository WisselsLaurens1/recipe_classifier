Whisk yoghurt in a bowl and then add garlic paste, ginger paste, red chilli powder and salt and mix well. Rub the marinade evenly on the turkey and set aside for a night.\nFor preparing the filling, wash green and red chillies. De-seed, and chop them. Add ghee in a kadhai, place it over medium flame and let it heat. Add the garlic and ginger pastes, and stir-fry until the moisture evaporates. Add the minced chicken the kadhai and saute for 2-3 minutes. Stuff the abdominal cavity of the turkey with almonds, pistachios, minced chicken, mace powder, green cardamom, garlic flakes and salt according to your taste. Stuff the tail end with boiled eggs. Then double up the legs, ensuring that the drumsticks cover the opening through which the filling was stuffed and tie firmly with a string. Gently twist the winglet bones to make the bird more stable when placed on its back. Add the remaining filling ingredients.\nFor preparing the gravy, whisk yoghurt in a bowl, add coriander, red chillies, turmeric, salt and mix properly. Keep aside for a while. Crush the saffron threads with a pestle or the back of a spoon, soak in rosewater and whisk properly to make a paste.\nSpread the onion paste in a large handi/pot. Sprinkle the cardamoms, cinnamon, cloves and bay leaves, arrange the stuffed turkey on top. Pour the chicken stock over the turkey. Let it boil over low flame. Cover and let it cook slowly for 50 minutes. Remove and arrange the turkey on a greased roasting tray and reserve the juice for the gravy. Pre-heat the oven at 375 degrees Fahrenheit.\nHeat ghee separately in a handi/pan, add the garlic and ginger pastes and stir-fry until the moisture evaporates. Then, add the almond and melon seed pastes and stir-fry. Add the fried onion paste and stir-fry until the fat leaves the sides. Add the reserved juice. Let it boil over low flame and keep stirring for 4-5 minutes. Remove and pass the gravy through a fine-mesh soup strainer into a separate handi/pan. Place thi handi on low flame and cook the gravy until it achieves sauce like consistency. Sprinkle the cardamom and mace powders, add the saffron and stir the gravy. Season it with salt according to your taste.\nPour the gravy over the turkey arranged in the roasting tray and bake in the pre-heated oven at 375 degrees Fahrenheit, basting with butter at regular intervals for 20-25 minutes or until the turkey is fully cooked and the gravy becomes brown. Remove from the oven, untie the turkey and reserve the gravy. Carve the turkey on a clean chopping board. Scoop a dollop of the stuffing on a plate and arrange 2-3 slices of turkey on the stuffing. Pour some gravy on the top.\nFor preparing the garnishing, dissolve saffron flakes in lukewarm water and when the water turns saffron, put almond flakes to enable them to acquire a saffron hue. Garnish with egg slices, pistachio, cashew nuts, toasted almonds and saffron threads and serve with pulao rice or any bread of your choice.", "nutrients": {"servingSize": "1 bowl", "calories": "734
