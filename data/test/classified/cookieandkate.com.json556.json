Toast the nuts/seeds on a rimmed baking sheet until fragrant and turning lightly golden on the edges, about 6 to 9 minutes. Transfer the nuts to a cutting board and roughly chop them.\nIn the meantime, melt the chocolate in a microwave-safe bowl in 30-second increments, stirring after each one. Don\u2019t overdo it. The chocolate is done when it\u2019s about 90% melted\u2014keep stirring off the heat and the pieces should completely dissolve. (Alternately, you can use melt it in a heat-proof bowl set over a saucepan of gently simmering water.)\nCover a large, rimmed baking sheet with parchment paper. Use a silicone or rubber spatula to spread chocolate evenly over the center area of the baking sheet\u2014aim for about \u00bc\u2033 thickness (it won\u2019t reach the edges).\nSprinkle the nuts evenly over the chocolate, followed by the dried fruit. If you\u2019re adding flaky salt, crush it between your fingers as you sprinkle it over the chocolate. Lightly use your palms to press the toppings into the chocolate.\nIf you\u2019re in a hurry, place the pan on a flat surface in the refrigerator to harden for about 15 minutes. If you\u2019re not, let the chocolate cool at room temperature for 2 to 4 hours, until completely hardened.\nOnce the chocolate is completely hardened, use your hands to break it into about 25 pieces. Serve immediately, or cover and store at room temperature for up to 1 week.", "nutrients": {"servingSize": "1 of 25 pieces, made as shown", "calories": "100", "sugarContent": "6.7 g", "sodiumContent":
