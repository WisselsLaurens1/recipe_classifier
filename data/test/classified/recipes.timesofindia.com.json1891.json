Then peel the garlic and mince them completely. Also dice the carrots in another bowl. Now, wash the kale and celery leaves and chop them too. And last but not the least, if you are using frozen peas, soak them for about 10 minutes to let them thaw. This will make the peas soft.\nCook 2 cups of quinoa with 4 cups water, a spritz of olive oil and 1/2 tsp salt. Bring the mixture to a boil on high flame for about 5 minutes. Lower the flame after 5 minutes, cover and let it simmer until they are cooked completely, about 10 minutes. Fluff it with a fork and set aside to cool.\nAdd a tablespoon of olive oil and minced garlic into a pan on medium flame. Then add in onions, peas and carrots. Turn the flame from medium to high and saute the veggies for a few minutes.\nAdd in the chopped kale and saute for two more minutes. Now, toss in the cooked quinoa and combine the mixture. Add salt and pepper as per your taste; toss them all together gently. Turn off the flame.\nBased on your taste preferences, you can enjoy this salad hot or cold as you like.", "nutrients": {"servingSize": "1 bowl", "calories": "292 cal"}, "links":
