Cut the broccoli florets into bite-sized pieces. Trim the ends off the sprouts; cut the small sprouts in two through the stem, and the large sprouts into quarters.\nToss the florets and sprouts in the olive oil so they are lightly coated, and sprinkle with the salt. Spread the florets and sprouts in a single layer on the baking sheet (be sure not to overcrowd). Bake for 24 to 28 minutes, tossing halfway, until the vegetables are crisp-tender and well caramelized on the edges.\nIn the meantime, bring the water to a boil in a medium saucepan. Stir in the lentils. Reduce the heat, cover and simmer for 20 to 25 minutes, until the lentils are tender but still retain their shape. Drain off any excess water.\nWhisk together the vinaigrette ingredients while the roasted vegetables and lentils cool a bit.\nIn a large serving bowl, combine the roasted vegetables, cooked lentils and arugula. Drizzle with vinaigrette, sprinkle in the Parmesan and toss well. Taste and add more lemon juice (for more zing), salt (for more overall flavor), and/or pepper, if needed. This salad is best served immediately.", "nutrients": {}, "links": ["https://cookieandkate.com#comment-656097", "https://cookieandkate.com/tag/avocado/",
