For the same, boil the green raw bananas and the potatoes till done and allow them cool naturally. Once done, peel and mash them in a bowl and add salt for taste. i\nNext, to the bowl of mashed banana and potatoes, add besan (2 tablespoons), paneer (50 gms), turmeric powder (1/4 teaspoon), tomato (1 sliced), green chilli (1 small), ginger paste (1/2 teaspoon), coriander powder (1/4 teaspoon), green coriander (2 stems, cut into pieces), crushed black cardamom (1/2 teaspoon), salt (according to taste) along with water (as required). Mix well all the ingredients to make a smooth dough like consistency.\nDivide this mixture into small parts and shape them into smooth medium balls. Now, put a kadhai over medium flame and heat oil in it. To this oil, add 2 tablespoons of ghee. Once this ghee and oil mixture is hot enough, add these balls and deep fry them. Turnover the koftas and fry them till they turn brown in colour. Now, you take out the koftas in a plate and follow the same method for frying rest of the koftas. Your banana kofta is ready for biryani and curry.\nFor kofta curry, put the mustard or refined oil (1/2 cup) and ghee (1 tablespoon) into a large pan. Then, add red chilli (1), green chilli (3), bay leaf (2), crushed black cardamom (1/2 teaspoon) in the pan and let them crackle. Next, add and fry carrot (1/2 cup, sliced), bean (1 cup), beetroot (1, small and sliced), peas (1 cup), tomato (2), salt (according to taste), turmeric powder (1/4 teaspoon), capsicum (1) and coriander powder (4 teaspoon). Stir and mix well, and fry all these vegetables for about 10 minutes.\nNow, put 1-2 cup water (according to taste) into the mixed masala when the masala starts boiling, boil again for 2 minutes. Put (the garam masala) cinnamon stick (3), peppercorns (4), cumin seed (1/2 small spoon), ginger paste (1 teaspoon), clove (3), green coriander (3 stems, cut into pieces), sugar, cashew nuts (2 teaspoon) and koftas (1 medium bowl) into the curry. Lightly stir and mix all the ingredients properly. Turn off the gas knob and the kofta will take 5 minutes to be hot. Now take out the recipe in a large bowl. You can garnish it with green coriander (1 sliced) and raisins. Your banana kofta is ready to serve. (Note: You can eat Kofta Curry with Shahi Veg Biryani, rice, bread, roti and chapati.)\nThe next step is to prepare biryani. For the same, soak the soybeans in enough water for 15-20 minutes. Then, boil these soybeans until they become soft. Drain the water and keep them aside. Afterwards, make a fine paste of clove (2), peppercorns (2), coriander powder, cinnamon stick, black cardamon and green chilli by grinding them in a grinder jar.\nNow, cut paneer (100 gms) into small pieces in a bowl and keep aside. Then, put a kadhai over medium flame and add enough oil in it or shallow frying. Once the oil is hot enough, add the paneer pieces and fry them. Once done, keep aside until required. Put a large bowl on medium flame and add rice in it along with enough water to boil. Then, add the prepared spice paste in the rice to enhance the flavour and sprinkle a little salt as per your taste and ghee (1 tablespoon). Once the rice is done, keep aside for later use.\nNow, take a deep vessel and heat ghee(1 tablespoon) and refined oil (1/2 cup) in it. Once the oil-ghee mixture is hot enough, add all the remaining spices and let them crackle for a minute. Then, add finely chopped tomato (1), carrot (1), beans (1 cup), beetroot (1/2 cup) in the vessel along with peas (1 cup), green chilli (2 small), salt (1 teaspoon). Saute these veggies for about a minute or two and then add ginger paste in it along with sliced capsicum. Stir fry for 2-3 minutes.\nFinally, add the prepared koftas (2 cup) in this vessel along with, red chili, coriander powder (1/2 teaspoon), crushed black cardamom (1/2 teaspoon), cinnamon stick (4), clove (3), peppercorns (3), cashew nuts and raisin (1/2 cup), bay leaf (2), sugar (1/2 teaspoon), paneer (50-100 gms). Cook the mixture till the mixture leaves oil on the sides of the vessel.\nNow, add the boiled soybean chunks and let the mixture cook for another 5 minutes. Finally, add the boiled rice and mix with the mixture properly. You can add koftas after boiled rice also. Allow the biryani to cook for five minutes. Garnish the biryani with kesar (saffron) and veg salad. Your mix veg biryani is ready to eat. Serve it with kofta curry or boondi raita.", "nutrients": {"servingSize": "1 bowl", "calories": "629 cal"}, "links": ["https://recipes.timesofindia.com/beverage/cocktails/bloodhound/rs56036742.cms",
