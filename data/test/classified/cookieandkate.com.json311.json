Process until the mixture is all mixed together and very finely chopped.\nWhile running the food processor, slowly drizzle in the olive oil. Scrape down the sides and blend until the sauce is mostly smooth.\nAdjust to taste\u2014for a spicier sauce, add the jalape\u00f1o seeds or additional red pepper flakes (\u00bc teaspoon at a time) and blend again. Too bitter? You can add more salt or give the flavors some time to mellow. This sauce\u2019s flavor transforms with time, so if it\u2019s too spicy or you just don\u2019t love it right off the bat, let it chill in the fridge and try it again in an hour.", "nutrients":
