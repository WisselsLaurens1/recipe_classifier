Make sure when you marinate the meat, it is moist. Then prick the meat with a fork this will help in better absorption of the marinade. Take a large bowl, add the garam masala, salt, ginger-garlic paste, red chilli powder, turmeric powder and two cups of curd. Beat the mixture well and then add then meat pieces. Cover this marinated meat and refrigerate overnight for better results.\nIn the meantime, wash the rice properly and half cook the rice. Once done, divide the rice into two portions. In the meantime, take some milk and add the saffron strands. Then mix one part of rice with the saffron mixture.\nNext, take a pan and fry thinly sliced onions until golden brown. Add 1/3 of the golden-brown onion to the mutton marination and keep the rest aside.\nTake a large handi or a deep bottomed pan, add the marinated mutton at the bottom and top it with half-cooked rice and a layer of saffron rice. Add mint leaves, coriander leaves and top it up with fried onions. Cover the handi with a lid and to make it more flavoursome, then wrap the lid with dough. This will cook the meat in the steam using the slow cooking process.\nAfter cooking the biryani for 45 minutes to 1 hour, remove the lid and nicely mix the layers and delicious Hyderabadi Mutton Biryani is ready to relish. Indulge with the goodness of this Hyderabadi Mutton biryani with Mirchi ka Salan.", "nutrients": {"servingSize": "1 bowl", "calories": "850 cal"}, "links":
