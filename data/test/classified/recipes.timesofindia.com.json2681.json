Pour the required amount of water and knead the mixture to form a smooth dough. Cover it with a lid and keep it aside for half an hour.\nIn the meanwhile, take a non-stick pan and add powdered jaggery, grated coconut, roasted sesame seeds, nutmeg powder, cardamom powder and a bit of water to it. Over a medium flame, cook and stir the mixture until it is dry. Allow the cooked mixture to cool for a while. Further, take another shallow bottomed frying pan and start preheating the refined oil into it over a medium flame.\nNow, pull a small portion from the dough and roll it into a shape of a disc (about 4 inches in diameter). Carefully, place the disc on your palm and start adding the cooked filling (Step 2) right in the centre of the disc. Start pinching the edges towards the centre and secure the filling. Repeat the step for making other modaks.\nCarefully, drop the modak into the hot oil and shallow fry it. Fry modaks in different batches until they turn a beautiful golden brown in colour. Drain the excess oil onto an absorbent towel. Transfer them onto a fancy plate and serve the delicious modak to Lord Ganesha.", "nutrients": {"servingSize": "1 bowl", "calories": "155 cal"}, "links":
