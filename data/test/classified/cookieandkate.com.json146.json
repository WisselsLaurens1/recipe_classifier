Scramble 8 eggs with 3 tablespoons cream/milk, \u00bc teaspoon salt and a few twists of freshly ground black pepper. Set the eggs aside for later.\nSlice 4 tortillas into short, thin strips (see photos). Transfer the strips to your prepared baking sheet, then toss with 1 \u00bd teaspoons olive oil until lightly and evenly coated. Arrange them in a single layer and sprinkle with salt. Bake until crispy, flipping halfway, about 8 to 10 minutes.\nMeanwhile, cook the pepper-and-onion mixture. In a medium saucepan over medium heat, warm 2 teaspoons olive oil. Add the chopped onion, bell pepper, jalape\u00f1o, garlic and a dash of salt. Cook, stirring often, until the onions are turning translucent and the peppers are tender, about 5 minutes. Transfer half of the mixture to a bowl for later and return the pot to heat.\nTo the pot, add 1 teaspoon ground cumin and saut\u00e9 until fragrant, stirring constantly, about 30 seconds. Add the drained black beans and 3 tablespoons water. Stir to combine. Reduce heat to low, cover and simmer until you\u2019re ready to serve.\nOnce you have your crispy tortilla strips and reserved pepper mixture ready, you can scramble the eggs. In a 10-inch non-stick or well-seasoned cast iron skillet, warm 2 teaspoons olive oil over medium heat. Swirl the pan so it\u2019s evenly coated with oil. Add the peppers from your bowl to the skillet, then whisk your egg mixture one last time and pour it into the skillet.\nScramble the eggs by pushing the mixture around and \u2019round and \u2019round until they\u2019re about three-fourths set. Fold in the crispy tortilla strips and cheese and continue cooking until the eggs are scrambled to your liking. Remove from heat.\nRemove the beans from heat. Use a fork to mash up about half the beans, then stir in a squeeze of lime or splash of vinegar. Season to taste with salt and pepper.\nDivide migas and black beans into individual serving bowls/plates. Top with a sprinkle of chopped cilantro. Serve with salsa, warmed tortillas (optional) and diced avocado (optional) on the side.", "nutrients": {}, "links": ["https://cookieandkate.com#comment-259597",
