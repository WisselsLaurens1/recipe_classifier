Add the onion and a pinch of salt and cook, stirring often, until the onion is tender and turning translucent, about 5 minutes.\nAdd the grated potato, garlic, paprika, chili powder, cumin, garlic powder, onion powder and salt. Stir to combine, and cook, stirring constantly, for 1 to 2 minutes to enhance their flavors.\nAdd the cashews and water, and stir to combine. Let the mixture come to a simmer. Continue simmering, stirring frequently and reducing heat as necessary to avoid a rapid boil, until the potatoes are completely tender and cooked through, about 5 to 8 minutes.\nCarefully pour the mixture into a blender, but keep the pot handy for later. Add the nutritional yeast, sun-dried tomatoes, hot sauce and vinegar. Blend until the mixture is completely smooth, about 2 minutes, stopping to scrape down the sides if necessary. If the mixture won\u2019t blend easily or if you would prefer a thinner consistency, add water in \u00bc cup increments, blending after each one.\nTaste, and blend in additional salt until the queso is utterly irresistible (I typically add about \u00bd teaspoon more). Pour the mixture back into the pot and add the tomatoes or salsa and jalape\u00f1os, if using. Cook over medium heat, stirring constantly, until the mixture is very warm.\nTo serve it as a dip, transfer to a serving bowl and top with any garnishes you\u2019d like. Or to make nachos, drizzle it generously over a bed of tortilla chips and garnish as desired. Serve immediately. Leftovers taste even better the next day! Store cooled leftover queso in a bowl, covered, in the refrigerator for up to 5 days. Gently reheat on the stove or in the microwave, stirring frequently, until warmed throughout.", "nutrients": {"servingSize": "1/2 cup", "calories": "217", "sugarContent": "3.3 g", "sodiumContent":
