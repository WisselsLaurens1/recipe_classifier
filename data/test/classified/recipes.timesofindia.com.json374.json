For the same, take a bowl and mix gram flour with 1 chopped onion, poppy seeds, 1 green chilli, and 2 tbsp oil. Using a little water, knead the dough well.\nNow, take a little oil in your hand and apply all over the palms. Take a little oil and make a thick roll of it. Repeat to make more such rolls.\nNow, put a deep-bottomed pan over medium flame and boil water in it. Then, carefully add the thick rolls in boiling water and let them boil for 15 minutes.\nOnce done, bring out the rolls from water and let them cool. Cut them into halves.\nNow, put a kadhai over medium flame and heat enough oil in it for deep frying the halved rolls. Once the oil is hot enough, fry the rolls till golden brown in colour.\nNow, you need to make the gravy for the fried gatte. For the same, take a pressure cooker and add oil in it. When the oil is hot enough, add the 3 finely chopped onion in it and saute until golden brown in colour.\nNow, add tomato puree in the cooker along with chopped ginger and garlic, and remaining green chillies. Cook for 2-3 minutes and then add turmeric, coriander powder, red chilli powder and salt to taste. Stir well and cook for 2-5 minutes on low flame. You can cover the cooker with a lid.\nFinally, add the fried gatte in the prepared curry and keep stirring till the oil leaves its sides. Finally, add water in the cooker to thicken the gravy. Close the pressure cooker with its lid and let the whistle come. After one whistle, slow down the flame and cook it for 5-10 minutes.\nOnce its cooked, let the steam release on its own and open the lid of the cooker. Garnish the curry with finely chopped coriander leaves and enjoy with chapati or rice.", "nutrients": {"servingSize": "1 bowl", "calories": "395 cal"}, "links":
