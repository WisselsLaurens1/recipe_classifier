Line a large, rimmed baking sheet with parchment paper for easy clean-up, if desired. If your baking sheet is smaller than mine, you may need to make the toast in two batches.\nDice your tomatoes and transfer them to a medium mixing bowl, leaving the tomato seeds and juice behind on the cutting board. Stir the salt into the tomatoes, and add the onion, basil and garlic as they are ready. Stir to combine and set the mixture aside to marinate while you work on the bread.\nSlice your baguette on the diagonal into pieces no wider than \u00bd-inch (see photos). I can usually fit 20 to 24 slices on my large baking sheet; you might have some bread left over. Lightly brush both sides of each slice with olive oil (this will require about 2 to 3 tablespoons oil).\nPlace the slices in a single layer on your prepared baking sheet and bake them on the middle rack for 6 to 9 minutes, until they\u2019re crisp and nicely golden on top. Transfer the toasts to a serving platter(s), if desired, and set aside.\nWhen you\u2019re ready to serve, carefully drain off the excess tomato juice that has accumulated in the bowl, using your hand as a stopgap. Add the remaining 2 tablespoons of olive oil. Stir to combine, and season the mixture with additional salt, to taste (I usually add another \u00bc to \u00bd teaspoon). If you don\u2019t feel like your bruschetta is garlicky enough (I like mine lightly but not overwhelmingly garlicky), add another pressed clove of garlic.\nTop each toast with tomato mixture, tipping your spoon against the bowl to release excess juice as necessary. Lightly drizzle a couple of tablespoons of thick balsamic vinegar on top, and sprinkle lightly with flaky salt if you have any. Bruschetta is best served promptly.", "nutrients": {"servingSize": "1 bruschetta", "calories": "64", "sugarContent": "1.4 g", "sodiumContent": "136.5 mg", "fatContent": "3.2 g", "saturatedFatContent":
