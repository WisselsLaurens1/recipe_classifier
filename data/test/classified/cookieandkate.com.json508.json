Scrub the beets well with a vegetable brush under running water (no need to peel them at any point).\nUsing a sharp chef\u2019s knife, slice off the base of each beet to create a flat surface, and slice off the skinny pointy ends as well. Place each beet with its flat side against the cutting board and slice the beets in half, then slice the beets into wedges of even thickness, about \u00bd to \u00be-inch thick on the widest edge.\nPlace the beet wedges on the prepared baking sheet. Drizzle the beets with the olive oil and sprinkle with the salt. Toss until the beets are evenly coated, then arrange them in a single layer across the pan.\nRoast for 35 to 40 minutes, tossing halfway, until you\u2019re able to pierce through the beets with a fork with light pressure. Season with additional salt, to taste, if desired, and serve.", "nutrients": {"servingSize": "1 side serving", "calories": "103", "sugarContent": "11.5 g", "sodiumContent": "278 mg", "fatContent":
