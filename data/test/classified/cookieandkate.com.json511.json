To slice, use a sharp chef\u2019s knife to cut them into 1-inch thick rounds. Then, cut up each round to make 1-inch cubes. The \u201ccubes\u201d won\u2019t be perfectly even, but that\u2019s ok.\nPlace the sweet potatoes on the prepared baking sheet. Drizzle the olive oil on top. If using, sprinkle the chili pepper or several twists of freshly ground black pepper on top, followed by the salt. Toss until the sweet potatoes are all evenly coated in oil, and arrange them in a single layer.\nBake for 30 to 40 minutes, tossing halfway, until the sweet potatoes are tender and caramelizing at the edges. Serve while warm. Leftover sweet potatoes will keep in the refrigerator, covered, for about 4 days. Gently reheat in the microwave or oven if desired.", "nutrients": {"servingSize": "1 side portion", "calories": "255", "sugarContent": "9.5 g", "sodiumContent": "270.1 mg", "fatContent": "7.1 g",
