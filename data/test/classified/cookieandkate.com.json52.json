Fill the glass with ice.\nFill the glass with club soda nearly to the top. Gently stir in a circular motion to combine, then use your spoon to drag some of the muddled mint higher up into the glass.\nTaste, and stir in more sugar if desired. Add a drop or two of bitters, if desired.\nTo garnish, place the lime round in the glass. Gently clap the remaining sprig of mint between your palms (this releases some of the oils) and tuck it into your glass, leaving the top exposed. Serve cold, with a wide straw.", "nutrients": {"servingSize": "1 cocktail", "calories": "158", "sugarContent": "6.6 g", "sodiumContent": "1.2 mg", "fatContent": "0 g", "saturatedFatContent": "0 g",
