Start blending at low speed and increase to medium-high.\nContinue blending until the cream increases by nearly double\u2014it might seem like you\u2019re not doing much for a while, then the whipped cream will progress fairly quickly through stages.\nFor soft peaks, continue blending until the mixture resembles melted ice cream and retains light swirl marks when you lift the mixer. For medium peaks, continue blending until the mixture retains more significant, closer-together swirl marks when you lift the mixer and mostly retains those swirl marks when you scoop it onto a spoon (this is the classic consistency that you would see dolloped on a pumpkin pie). For stiff peaks, continue blending until the mixture has tight swirl marks and resembles Cool Whip (you could ice a cake with this texture). Don\u2019t overdo it, or your cream will start turning into butter!\nUse whipped cream as desired. Whipped cream will keep well in the refrigerator, covered, for up to 5 days. If the mixture has separated a bit, gently stir it back together with a spoon. Homemade whipped cream loses some volume over time, so you may need to lightly whip it again to achieve the original texture.", "nutrients": {"servingSize": "2 tablespoons", "calories": "55",
