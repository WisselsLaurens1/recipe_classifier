Process for about 1 \u00bd minutes, pausing to scrape down the sides and bottom as necessary, until the mixture is smooth and creamy.\nAdd half of the chickpeas to the food processor and process for 1 minute. Scrape down the bowl, then add the remaining chickpeas and process until the hummus is thick and smooth, 1 to 2 more minutes.\nWhile running the food processor, drizzle in 2 to 4 tablespoons of water, until it reaches your desired consistency and level of creaminess. Taste and season with additional salt (I added \u00bc teaspoon) and toasted sesame oil, if you want more pronounced sesame flavor (about \u00bd teaspoon). Set aside.\nToast the sesame seeds in a small skillet over medium heat, shimmying the skillet frequently, until they\u2019re starting to turn golden, about 2 to 4 minutes. Pour them into a bowl to prevent them from burning.\nScrape the hummus into a small serving bowl. Lightly drizzle 1 teaspoon sesame oil over the top. Sprinkle generously with sesame seeds and a light sprinkle of flaky sea salt (if using). Serve with accompaniments of your choice. Leftover hummus keeps well, chilled, for 4 to 5 days.", "nutrients": {"servingSize": "1 snack serving", "calories": "129", "sugarContent": "2 g", "sodiumContent": "279.5 mg", "fatContent": "8.5 g",
