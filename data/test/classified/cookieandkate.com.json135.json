Arrange them on a large serving platter, overlapping their edges and varying the shapes as best you can.\nCut the burrata or mozzarella into \u00bc\u2033 to \u00bd\u2033 slices (burrata is tricky since the inside is so creamy; I cut it into \u00bd\u2033 slices and gently tugged the slices into smaller sections, see photos). Tuck the cheese around and underneath the tomatoes, dispersing it relatively evenly across the platter.\nSprinkle basil leaves all over, and tuck a few more into the crevices. Drizzle the olive oil over the salad. Sprinkle generously with salt and pepper.\nFor the best flavor (if you have the time), let the salad rest for 30 minutes so the tomatoes release some juices and the flavors have time to mingle. This salad is best served within a few hours. Leftovers will keep, covered and refrigerated, for up to 3 days.", "nutrients": {"servingSize": "1/4th of recipe", "calories": "302", "sugarContent": "6.6 g", "sodiumContent": "512.9 mg",
