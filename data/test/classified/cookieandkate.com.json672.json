Bring a large pot of water to boil on the stove for the rice.\nCook the squash: Grease a large rimmed baking sheet or roasting pan. Whisk together the olive oil, 1 chipotle chile, adobo sauce, garlic, honey, and some salt and pepper in a small bowl (a mortar and pestle is ideal, so you can really mash together the ingredients). Taste and add another chile if you like.\nBrush the glaze evenly over the squash skewers and roast for 45 to 60 minutes, turning once or twice and basting with any pan juices. When the squash is tender and deeply colored, remove the skewers from the oven and set aside.\nTo cook the rice: Once your pot of water is boiling, pour in the rice and give it a stir. Boil the rice for 30 minutes, then turn off the heat and drain the rice. Return the rice to the pot and cover the pot. Let the rice steam for 10 minutes. Remove the lid, fluff the rice with a fork, then mix in the lime zest and juice, lemon juice, cilantro, butter and salt to taste.\nCook the beans: In a 10-inch skillet over medium heat, saut\u00e9 the onion and garlic in olive oil until fragrant. Add the cumin and stir until fragrant, about 30 seconds.\nPour in the beans and \u00bd cup water. Stir, cover and reduce heat to a simmer. Cook for 5 minutes, then remove the lid and use the back of a fork to mash up about \u00bd of the beans. Add the roasted red peppers, stir, and season with salt and pepper to taste. Cover until you\u2019re ready to serve.\nServe the beans on a bed of cilantro lime rice. Top with chipotle-glazed squash. Garnish with a couple of lime wedges.", "nutrients": {"servingSize": "1 serving of rice with beans and squash", "calories": "743", "sugarContent": "8 g", "sodiumContent": "829.3 mg", "fatContent":
