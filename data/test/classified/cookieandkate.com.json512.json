Using a serrated knife, slice through the loaf of bread horizontally to make two evenly-sized slabs. Place them on a large, rimmed baking sheet (lined with parchment paper for easy clean-up, if desired).\nRemove the cloves of roasted garlic from the heads. In a shallow bowl or plate, mash the cloves with a fork until mostly smooth. Add the butter and salt and mash it all together until evenly combined. Scoop half of the mixture onto the cut side of one piece of bread, and spread it evenly across with a butter knife or spatula. Repeat with the remaining garlic on the remaining bread.\nBake for 5 minutes (for softer bread) or 10 to 12 minutes, until golden at the edges and crisp enough to resist a gentle squeeze (for toasted bread as shown in photos).\nSprinkle with parsley. Once cool enough to handle, slice into pieces about 2 to 3 inches wide with a serrated knife. Serve promptly. Bread should be consumed or refrigerated within 2 hours.", "nutrients": {"servingSize": "1 slice", "calories": "178", "sugarContent": "1.9 g", "sodiumContent": "280 mg", "fatContent": "6.4 g",
