* random forest beter begrijpen

* hyperparameter tuning


TODO 
----------

*  rt-df analysis on ingredidents -> remove ingredients that are common in all ingredidents
*  Remove all adjectives from ingredidents -> order all ingredidents permutations by base ingredient
* correclation analysis between ingredidents --> maybe drop highly correelated 

* New rules to add:
    - add compound capturing (bv: phone book, feta cheese, hot dog)
        -> capture the compound noun of the direct object 
            -> also capture - compound nouns (bv: feta-cheese )

    - capture adj and check with word paring analysis if they occur often 
        -> if they occur in dataset -> add
            
    - lemmatise words: (bv:carrots -> carrot, .....)

* Possible complex rules:
    - handle conjunctions (https://universaldependencies.org/u/dep/conj.html)
